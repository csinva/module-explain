">On the evening of February 13th, I reached out to the netizens of the One Som Project about extending their helping hands to the people affected by the earthquake. It took as little as 4 days for The One Som Project netizens and brothers in Bortala to raise a donation worth 70,000 Som, 96 bags of clothing items equivalent to 4000 articles of clothing as well as 200 pieces of new clothing. In order to bring this whole commitment to the people in the most remote and neglected areas possible, 3 of the donors set out on a journey to Hotan on the 17th and started paying visits on the 19th. Another donor took with him 26 bags of clothing items to Urumqi to send out to Hotan, and returned the next day. The following is a diary of the donors who visited Keriye: 1. We arrived in Atchan Village of Keriye Prefecture. After learning that help did not reach the Kunes and Shung'gul villages because of bad road conditions, we decided to go there instead, as we were hoping to cover the places that needed the most help. The road did indeed turn out to be in terrible and dangerous condition. We barely finished the journey of 60 kilometers in 4 long hours. As a positive sign ,though, the young folks who had traveled quite a journey to greet us had a cross-country vehicle prepared. One would not be able to hold back tears seeing those grandpa-and-grandma-like old folks thanking you with tears in their eyes.

"Records indicate that Mother Nature has meted out punishment to humankind on a total of three occasions during the last one-hundred years. Two of these instances were in China. One instance was the great flood of 1931, in which in excess of 3.5 million people died in China. The second instance was the 1976 Tangshan Earthquake, where over 250 thousand died. More than 120 thousand people died in this current tsunami. Although there is a diminishing trend to the number of casualties in these three disasters, the figure of 120 thousand is nonetheless alarming indeed. Where the beaches of these countries were littered with human bodies, surprisingly there were no wild animal corpses to be found. Some animals, including elephants, during the preceding few days had already taken to their heels and headed for the mountains. And only after the tsunami was over did they come down to search for water. Is this an accident? Run Taoyan tells us it isn't!

"There was indeed an earthquake. The epicenter of the 7.3-magnitude earthquake was in a deserted area that is located more than 100 kilometers away from the downtown of Keriye and dozens of kilometers away from Atchan village. In addition to that, considering the 7.3 magnitude strong quake, because the earthquake occurred during the daytime and the area is sparsely populated, and many were at work instead of being at home, except for those collapsed houses (about 50 to 60 houses collapsed) and the death of few livestock, there was no greao loss. The old town of Keriye County, which is continuously being mentioned in websites, is a special zone of Keriye County that was the earliest residential area where the traditional Uyghur sedentary culture has been preserved, similar to the streets of Old Kashgar.

"Number of deaths in the Mediterranean Sea reaches record high In 2016, the number of deaths of refugees who tried to cross to Europe through the Mediterranean Sea exceeded a record high of 5,000. Compared to this, the number of refugees reaching the coasts of Europe, especially after the closure of the route from Turkey to Greece and other eastern routes, has decreased by two-thirds. The reason the death toll has reached 5,000 is because two boats capsized in the sea coasts of Italy, near Sicily. The Italian Coast Guard was unable to rescue 100 people out of 257 refugees. A spokesman of the UNHCR office, when talking about this incident, explained that on average 14 people were dying daily in 2016, hoping to find a better life in Europe. According to the report by the U.N. branch that deals with refugees, the type of boats being used by the traffickers were getting worse and their systems were getting more sophisticated to escape being tracked. In 2016, the traffickers used to send plenty of boats at the same time in order not to be arrested; this created problems for the rescue efforts and hence the number of deaths increased. The high increase in the death toll in the Mediterranean Sea has happened in the same year that the number of refugees reaching Europe has decreased. According to the reports by UNHCR, while one million refugees reached Europe in 2015, the number decreased to less than 360,000 in 2016. When compared with the number of refugees reaching Europe, the number of deaths in Mediterranean Sea has increased by one-third in 2016. In 2015, the death toll of refugees was 3,770; in 2014, this number was at 3,280. When compared with the high number of refugees and the fewer deaths prior to 2016, the probability of death while at sea increased three-fold in 2016. The real number of deaths is believed to be higher than what is reported. UNHCR reports that the deaths of hundreds of people trying to cross from Morocco to Spain are mostly not reported. Besides the unaccounted deaths at sea, in 2016 alone 1,100 refugees have reportedly died in the Sahara desert",no,"Input: Number of deaths in the Mediterranean Sea reaches record high In 2016, the number of deaths of refugees who tried to cross to Europe through the Mediterranean Sea exceeded a record high of 5,000.

The old town of Keriye County, which is continuously being mentioned in websites, is a special zone of Keriye County that was the earliest residential area where the traditional Uyghur sedentary culture has been preserved, similar to the streets of Old Kashgar. Here houses were adjacent to each other and the area is heavily populated, in addition to the existence of numerous old houses. For this reason, it's easy to say that some houses in this area might have been damaged by the quake. If so, what types of houses are they? Simply say, they are the houses that were damaged during the quake. The most shocking factor is the age of the houses. Some of them might be 50 to 60 years old while some of the newest ones would be 8 years old.

"Deaths in the Mediterranean have reached a climax. In 2016, the number of refugees who died trying to cross to Europe via the Mediterranean Sea surpassed 5000 people, a record number. Compared to this, the number of those who managed to set foot on the European coast, especially after the closure of the Eastern part of the Mediterranean that includes the route crossing from Turkey to Greece, has decreased by two-thirds. The number of deaths reached 5000 after two boats sank on December 22, near Sicilia on the Italian coast. The Italian coast guards could not rescue more than 100 of the 257 passengers on the two boats. The spokesperson of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees, speaking about the devastating accident, said that the 2016 figure shows that every day an average of 14 people were dying in search of a better life in Europe. According to the UN branch attending to refugee affairs, as the type of boats that the smugglers use went on getting worse, the system that they pursue to avoid being caught also became more sophisticated. In 2016, the system that the smugglers used to avoid being caught involved sending too many boats at once, which made rescue missions difficult and caused the largest number of deaths. Theis big increase in the number of deaths that occur in the Mediterranean happened during a year when the minimum number of people who actually reach Europe has declined sharply. According to the International Organization for Refugee Affairs, in 2015 about one million refugees reached European shores, while the total for 2016 is only 360,000. Compared to the number of refugees who have flown to Europe, the number of people who have died in the Mediterranean has increased by a third. In 2015, over 3,770 refugees were lost, while in 2014 about 3,280 died. Compared to the pre-2016 record flow of refugees and death tolls, deaths at sea in 2016 increased three times over. The actual number of deaths is estimated to exceed the reported ones. The International Organization for Refugee Affairs says that hundreds of deaths that occur during the crossing from Morocco to Spain are mostly left unreported. Apart from the unreported deaths at sea, the accurate count of the refugees lost during journeys across the Sahara in 2016 reached at least 1,100",no,"Input: Deaths in the Mediterranean have reached a climax.

"Women rights would not be guaranteed by the EPRDF. It's a known fact that women are half of society. Because of the policies of the past autocratic rulers in our country, women were not able to equally participate in the social, economic and political life of society. There was no chance for women to come out and express their voices and to express their democratic rights. Therefore, like any oppressed Ethiopian citizen, to liberate themselves from the misery, hardship and oppression, and to secure their democratic rights, social justice, equality, peace and economic development, Ethiopian women, and especially the women of Tigray, played a major role in the 17 years of remarkable struggle and paid heavily in terms of life and disability. Women of our country have contributed everything required by the struggle for their own rights and the rights of the oppressed population. During the struggle, they faced natural and human-made obstacles, but confronted these obstacles by arming themselves on an equal footing with their brothers; participating equally fearlessly in battles, facing bullets and land mines, and acted like lionesses. Ethiopian women, and especially Tigray women, have paid a heavy toll in terms of life and disability; they performed historic and heroic acts; and became lionesses, achieving their objectives in total victory. The fruit of their struggle and sacrifices, however, have been hijacked by the treacherous TPF/EPRDF regime, and the victory that was paid for in blood is wasted. Today, women are facing countless problems and live abject conditions. As the entire dispossessed population of Ethiopia did not see the fruits of its spectacular 17-year struggle, women, as half of society, have not been able to realize any gains, either. Therefore, since the governance that women and the whole country are subjected to is so abusive and atrocious, women, like all members of society, are devoid of their rights. They are experiencing double abuse by the TPLF/EPRDF regime. They are burdened by these problems and are in dire conditions of merciless poverty, migration, famine, diseases, ignorance, abuse, imprisonment, suffering and death. The abuse of human rights and unemployment prevailing in our country have created disorder in the social livelihoods of women. Those sisters of ours who cannot withstand all these problems have emigrated to take refuge elsewhere and are facing abuse and humiliation along the way. Even for their future lives to live freely fighting for their privileges, they have been deprived to struggle for their rights, to organize and to educate themselves. They keep them in darkness. In name only, the regime talks tactically of associations, leagues, women's federation, Meles leadership training academy, etc. Presenting women as part and parcel of the evil regime, it does everything to keep them under its full control, obedient to its policies, by depriving them of their human rights. Therefore, the struggle that was aimed at justice, peace, democratic rights, equality and respect has been hijacked. It is serving the needs of the minority. Today, because of cheap and cliquish administration, the country and its people are moving toward dangerous downfall and confusion with the unity of the country in perils. This has led to the lives of innocent citizens to vanish in streets. Many citizens are being hunted and taken to prisons by security forces for crimes they didn't commit. This increases the agony and suffering of our mothers and sisters. This is because women are the social life of society. Therefore, the ruling EPRDF regime, which, for the last 25 years, committed atrocities by trampling the rights of citizens, and especially those of women, it will not guarantee human and democratic rights now. Therefore, without difference of gender, we must get rid of the selfish regime by joining the process of armed struggle for democratic change",no,"Input: Women rights would not be guaranteed by the EPRDF.

"The third Patriarch, His Holiness Antonios, who is under house arrest, has had his phone taken away after refusing to sign to admit guilt and remorse. The third Patriarch, His Holiness Antonios, is under house arrest after being forced to step down from his position at the Orthodox Church by the Issaias regime and his cronies from the Sinod after 10 years, having done no wrong. Sources have informed us that he refused to sign an admission of guilt and remorse offered him by higher security officials of the regime on August 30, 2016 and has had his phone taken away. The regime's agents, in a continuation of their so-called reconciliation efforts, held meetings with him repeatedly, and in the course of an appointment yesterday, Tuesday August 30, the agents pleaded with the Third Patriarch, His Holiness Antonios, to admit his guilt and to remove his ban on the members of the Sinod, but he reaffirmed his rejection of the agents, saying, ""I will not sign today and I will not sign tomorrow; I have spoken."" And as a punishment, the agents took away his phone and left him under house arrest. The sources added that they are concerned for the health of the Third Patriarch, His Holiness Antonios, reminding that he is advanced in age and has chronic diseases, and that they are worried that the pressure from the regime's agents will further deteriorate his health. They have also called on religious leaders and followers to pray for him. In the past few weeks different groups, including national church branches in North America, Europe and the Middle East, made joint announcements denouncing a prior announcement made by the dictatorial regime of Issaias in collusion with his agents that claimed that the Patriarch, His Holiness Antonios, said: ""...I admit to all my mistakes whether intentional or not, and my sincere apologies to the Holy Church and to the Holy Sinod."" They explained that the regime and the self-appointed Patriarch are the ones who should apologize, and not Patriarch Antonios, who is a victim. And they also suggested that, if the process is for reconciliation and is to be accepted by the public, an independent third party should participate as an observer, witness and mediator",no,"Input: The third Patriarch, His Holiness Antonios, who is under house arrest, has had his phone taken away after refusing to sign to admit guilt and remorse.

"The round-up report on Kiriye. Because of poor network service, I could not renew news on my blog. Please forgive me. We have reached Keriye county, and are going on our trip to the affected region. Recently, people on Wechat complained and argued about both a Turkish singer and the people who spread news about this singer, which made Wechat a battling site. Since yesterday, the comments on Mis Ra Nim web had started to blame Xinjiang TV Station for spreading that news. Everyone has turned their attention to the earthquake, and we have left for there. We criticized our entrepreneurs, but they also left for the affected region this morning. So those complaints have vanished. Following that, we started to blame those who had not reached the site. According to the information given by the youth, some young people and companies will reach the site tomorrow morning. And then, some people are still blaming them. But in fact, those companies are helping the victims. Now we've started to blame the people who are on their way to the disaster site. We sincerely hope that our friends' diseases are cured as soon as possible. If God allows, we will arrive at the affected region to report the situation in the next two days. We appeal to our friends to spread the solidarity and kindness, not rumors, on our Uyghur's Wechat moment. Thanks. We have visited some families whose houses were damaged. Miras Company has offered clothes, food, and drink to the victims, as well as our brothers' greetings. Our website interviewed some of the victims. God willing, we will publish it on our website soon. Currently, everyone looks very well and energetic. Second stop is Achchan Township. Other news relates to Keriye from Uyghur bloggers. May peace be upon you, my friends. We landed in Hotan from Urumqi around 9:00 this morning. Then, we left for the affected regions, with the donation from our companies, Abida and Miras, as well as the microphones, provided by websites including Misranim, Anatuprak, Karwan, and Qimbulak. Certainly, this place is more than 50 kilometers away from Kiriye. We successfully delivered the food and clothes to the victims. The magnitude of 7.3 in the report is really high; however, thankfully, Allah has blessed our town and given this miracle. We knew from the Aqqang Township government that no one was injured, and only some houses were toppled. Of course, this is due to the fact that the earthquake occurred in a sparsely populated rural region. A rockslide damaged 150,000Mu of grassland, which caused 319 livestock to be killed. The pictures you saw on Wechat in recent days are from the most seriously damaged place. In total, there are only 10 pictures. We know that the reports from news agencies from the Central government and the Autonomous Region are from those pictures. However, some people on the Internet have posted pictures from the previous year's earthquake, giving wrong information. What you have seen here is the real condition of Uyghur people in this rural area. They are too poor to assemble donations. People who came here to assist these victims also updated with live reports. Now I want to say, please collect donations based on their need. We really need the necessary supplies. The victims are living in emergency tents, and because the affected region is in the mountains, they need coal for warming. Because so much land has been damaged, they need fodder for their herds too. Please remember to visit the poor Uyghur people in rural areas regardless of any excuse. I wish someone could collect money to cover the volunteers' travelling expenses. In this way, we could spend money on other poor Uyghur people in other rural areas, because this is a sparsely populated region, whose area is very large. Even if you reach here, you would not know where to find them. We are touched by people's motivations, reflecting a united spirit that says that, if one side is in trouble, the other sides will come to help. So, I advise those hesitating to come, think carefully. Accordingly, the current supplies and donations from our enterprisers and the government have exceeded expectations. ...... May Allah keep you all healthy ...... Ababakri Muhtar, reported from Misranim: an affected region, not a disaster region. May peace be up on you, my friends. I'm representing Misranim, Anatuprak, Qimbulak and Karwan websites to give a live report regarding to the condition of the affected regions. As I said at the beginning, words like ""disaster region"" in articles undoubtedly shocked everyone. A disaster region is an unfortunate place we don't want to visit. The correct term should be ""an affected region."" Please pay attention to your word usage. This morning, after a conversation with the leader of Keriye County, I found out that, since yesterday evening, many friends have delivered fodder and coal for the victims. Even the supplies from the government have exceeded the people's needs. I suggest other friends not come here, as other media have reported, because this situation is not as bad as it sounds. But still, with Allah's mercy, I am sad, having seen our friends' poverty. The people, who are already poor, attract our attention after this earthquake. God know how many poor families like them are existing in Xinjiang. After all, distributing the donated supplies has become a problem. Many charities are raising donations now, but the families live far away from each other. Under the circumstances, it is almost impossible to deliver the supplies to them.

"Who would accuse the criminals? Help was needed We need help from qualified policemen and reporters. I am the son of a farmer from the remote countryside. I didn't know much about law. A thief entered my store at 2:50 a.m. on December 31st, 2012. My brother, minding the store, captured the thief, who turned out to be a relative. My brother was stabbed 5 times by the thief and lost much blood during his pursuit of the thief. The doctor diagnosed him with pulmonary venous pleonaemia. The doctor said that an operation was necessary and we had to pay an extra 20,000 yuan in operation fees in addition to money for blood. The police paid no attention to this case. Was there any law to help us capture the missing thief? That was what I meant. I beg your sincere help. It happened on December 31st, but no one came to take fingerprints till January 2nd. Abduxukur: 13899990642 We might sooner capture the thief if we gave the thief a label. What was sold at that store? The police would take charge of it if you captured the thief by yourselves. Remember that the police have no time for cases except for the three forces of national separatism, terrorism, and national disruption. Let's take the topic to its highest level. Let's take the topic to its highest level The thief might be someone from a leading nation or a friend of the police. You'd better depend on yourselves. One of my neighbors captured a thief with stolen sheep and hit him. Then the police threatened my neighbor and forced my neighbor to pay 700 yuan to the thief. My neighbor regretted calling the police. Did you forget to call the police? In the event of alarm, you may speak to the deaf policeman.... Why was my comment, which I felt okay about, deleted? What you could do now is treat your brother. It is the police's business to capture the criminal. Treat your brother even if you have to borrow money. You could charge him with criminal and civil liability at the proper time. You could tell the facts to the Public Security Bureau, a level superior to the local police. The charge was changed from theft to robbery. You said the thief was your relative. He would not steal something if he had money. You could also first discuss with your relatives how to treat your brother. Keep all the receipts and records of the treatment process with you. The content was an example of what Fidada wrote on fifth floor at 00:55 a.m., January 3rd, 2013. The thief might be someone from a leading nation or a friend of the police. You'd better depend on yourselves. One of my neighbors captured a thief with stolen sheep and hit him. The police threatened my neighbor and forced my neighbor to pay 700 yuan to the thief. My neighbor regretted calling the police. Didn't someone from a leading nation have a mustache? He said they were relatives. As one friend said, better to treat your brother with money paid by yourselves even if you have to borrow the money. It was very important. Then state the case to the deaf at the police station, but more loudly. Or submit a case to a superior police station. For example, you could choose the police station in your county if you lived in a village there. The one in the city was okay if you lived in a county. The Prefecture Police Station would be ideal if you lived in a city. There might be someone not blind or deaf to this case. Or we could tell the case to the Law and the People program to cure their deaf ears. ‏ It was more important to treat your brother. There still might be a solution to the case. May Allah make everything easy for you. We hear some weird things in this society, where some thieves can become policemen. The police rush to take charge in some cases involving national disruption and national separatism; they only cared also about someone with a mustache, veiled women, and other suspicious terrorists. They didn't spare their time unless you offered a bribe to them when it came to other cases. Didn't someone from a leading nation have mustache? He said they were relatives. Could you please give your comment after you understand the case clearly? Why were your comments so weird? Could you be clearer? What did the sentence mean that they were relatives.......? Did it mean that the thief was of Han nationality? Could you be clearer? Whoever committed the theft should be punished by law. Didn't you see the situation from the Internet in which the thief was captured and beaten by the self-organized people of the interior land? There might be some spelling mistakes here, such as it should have been (relatives) not ""relatives."" Chances are that the victim was the full brother of the topic submitter. It was a major case for Kumul. The thief should have been put in prison if the theft happened in Kumul.................. I had no idea whether the police in Urumqi were busy or on their new year holiday. Better to go to the Public Security Bureau of the city for help. How about telling the police that the thief admitted his terrorist motivation? Then the police might have paid attention to the case. Call the police again. If they still turned a deaf ear to it, then contact the Law and the People program. They would have had to take charge of it if the case was open to the public. More and more people needed others' push in their work. It was as if a donkey forgot its obligations without food or a clubbing. Why did you feel the program of the Law and the People was so important? It was a kind of propaganda method. The film was made by the Commission of Politics after getting the permission of law from a related organization. I didn't like the person who had gone to the superior court but still argued that he go to the central government or the program of the Law and the People. The content was an example of the comments given by Kar from 18th floor on 14:08 p.m., January 3rd, 2013. It was a major case for Kumul. The thief would be in prison if the theft had happened in Kumul.................. I have no idea whether the police in Urumqi were busy or on their new year holiday. Better to go to the Public Security Bureau of the city for help. It seemed that he was not in Urumqi. He might be in Hotan. I would be willing to help him dial the telephone number if he gave me the area code. I gave a lesson to someone who committed domestic violence last night. I would call the police if you hit your wife again. You would be in prison for 15days because of your criminal actions. I would call your office and you would be dismissed from your post if you let them go hungry without giving them the cards for electricity, water, the heating system, and gas. Do not think that the women had nowhere to go. I have recorded every word you said from then on. I put pressure on him by testifying in court. Then he failed to sleep the whole night and sent the cards home at half past five in the morning. He added that he had been afraid of losing the cards and so took them away. I wasn't kidding. I would have thought to call the police to arrest him if he still hit his poor wife with his big body of 115 kilograms. It might be the police from the South. They didn't care much about the security case you mentioned. They would spare no effort to deal with it if it were a case about politics. They were even reluctant to go out with you, with the excuse that they had to be on duty if you called the police. Why didn't you tell them that they were terrorists who tried to divide the country or nation? You would be without hope if you wanted help from qualified policemen and reporters. Because you turned to those for help who forget their obligations......... Better to solve the problem by yourself. You could definitely get some messages from the society. The thief must have known about your store and he must have been hurt. The content was an example of the comments given by Ablikim from second floor at 23:28 p.m., January 2nd, 2013. The police would take charge of it if you captured the thief by yourselves. Remember that the police have no time for cases except those involving the three forces of national separatism, terrorism, and national disruption. You hit the nail on the head. They have time for mustaches and veils. However, as for the other things.... The content was an example of the comments given by Asma0999 from 21st floor at 17:08 p.m., January 3rd, 2013. Why did you feel the program of law and the people was so important? It was a kind of propaganda method. The film was made by the Commission of Politics after getting the permission of law from a related organization. I didn't like the person who had gone to the superior court but still argued that he go to the central government or the program of the Law and the People. What you said was so right, with a powerful argument. The police were searching for the criminal. Who else could capture him? You'd better call the local police again and again, making sure that you do not destroy the crime scene. If the local police ares deaf, then call the police a level superior to the local one. Do not try to say that a terrorist attacked your store, even if some Web friends suggest this just in kidding. You would end up in prison instead of the thief if you told the police this, after seeing a battalion of soldiers coming at you. The police really have ignored their duty these years. I would like to spit on them when I saw the policemen on the street. It was their luck not to meet me. One of my cousins, whose name escapes my mind, was arrested at an electronic gambling house in an Awat farm by a police station of Korla City. Then the police released him because of his local residence. I felt strange. That gambling house was open till now. I feel ashamed of jerks who dominate the world. A guy from our village was hit with sticks severely by a group of people from the city arriving in three full cars. After we called the police of Awat, the police blamed the guy who was hit instead of handling the situation well. They didn't give any information about it till now although more than two months have passed. Why did they fail to solve little problems even though cameras were available everywhere? How useless they were as national servants engaged in law. We informed the police of those three cars' license plate numbers at that time. How useless they were. It was strange that reporters failed to report this kind of unfair case, which was of real concern to people. Treat your brother first. It is most important to keep one's health. Be patient! And the police will punish the criminals according to the law. Contact Akbar or Xuhrat from Xinjiang Radio Station,,,",no,"Input: Who would accuse the criminals?

Why didn't you tell them that they were terrorists who tried to divide the country or nation? You would be without hope if you wanted help from qualified policemen and reporters. Because you turned to those for help who forget their obligations......... Better to solve the problem by yourself. You could definitely get some messages from the society. The thief must have known about your store and he must have been hurt. The content was an example of the comments given by Ablikim from second floor at 23:28 p.m., January 2nd, 2013. The police would take charge of it if you captured the thief by yourselves. Remember that the police have no time for cases except those involving the three forces of national separatism, terrorism, and national disruption. You hit the nail on the head. They have time for mustaches and veils. However, as for the other things.... The content was an example of the comments given by Asma0999 from 21st floor at 17:08 p.m., January 3rd, 2013. Why did you feel the program of law and the people was so important? It was a kind of propaganda method. The film was made by the Commission of Politics after getting the permission of law from a related organization. I didn't like the person who had gone to the superior court but still argued that he go to the central government or the program of the Law and the People. What you said was so right, with a powerful argument. The police were searching for the criminal. Who else could capture him? You'd better call the local police again and again, making sure that you do not destroy the crime scene. If the local police ares deaf, then call the police a level superior to the local one. Do not try to say that a terrorist attacked your store, even if some Web friends suggest this just in kidding. You would end up in prison instead of the thief if you told the police this, after seeing a battalion of soldiers coming at you. The police really have ignored their duty these years. I would like to spit on them when I saw the policemen on the street. It was their luck not to meet me. One of my cousins, whose name escapes my mind, was arrested at an electronic gambling house in an Awat farm by a police station of Korla City. Then the police released him because of his local residence. I felt strange. That gambling house was open till now. I feel ashamed of jerks who dominate the world. A guy from our village was hit with sticks severely by a group of people from the city arriving in three full cars. After we called the police of Awat, the police blamed the guy who was hit instead of handling the situation well. They didn't give any information about it till now although more than two months have passed. Why did they fail to solve little problems even though cameras were available everywhere? How useless they were as national servants engaged in law. We informed the police of those three cars' license plate numbers at that time. How useless they were. It was strange that reporters failed to report this kind of unfair case, which was of real concern to people. Treat your brother first. It is most important to keep one's health. Be patient! And the police will punish the criminals according to the law. Contact Akbar or Xuhrat from Xinjiang Radio Station,,, Answer: no

"Aids - the agony of Xinjiang Adip edited the post at the end. 13:21 18 -10-2015 Our brothers might remember I wrote an article titled ""The most beautiful Chinese woman in Xinjiang"" a couple days ago. In my article I personally expressed my gratitude to Mrs. Song Qingling, who earned people's respect by greatly contributing to the development of soccer in Xinjiang. 2. At the end of my article, I changed the subject from soccer, which is the hope of Xinjiang to Aids, which is the agony of Xinjiang and said that we were expecting the most beautiful Chinese lady in Xinjiang's Aids treatment and prevention campaign to please us. I mentioned that. 3. Actually, what I was implying was that the current first lady, Peng Liyuan, could do something for our Aids problems in Xinjiang. Nothing wrong with hoping for this. We Uyghur people have a proverb saying a mother does not breastfeed the baby if the baby does not cry. 4. The respected mother of the nation, Madam Peng Liyuan is a respected figure in the Aids campaign in China as well as all over the world. The coming of the first lady might make a new way for the research campaigns in Aids prevention that previously have not progressed. Also, it would be exciting if the first lady gives a speech to a of couple colleges in Xinjiang and would show support for young people of every nationality in Xinjiang. 5. http://bbs.izdinix.com/thread-65040-1-1.html This was the post with the title ""The most beautiful Chinese woman in Xinjiang."" Right, Aids is the common voice of the whole society. I hope our online friends observe things in a practical way and not an emotional way. If the registered beauty shops for foot washing were closed, one way of transmitting Aids would be blocked. It might be a big thing if Madam Peng Liyuan gives a speech. Ways for transmitting Aids are wide open. The best propaganda in our society is ""you will not be infected if you apply the condom correctly."" Actually, if the propaganda said ""do not do things that will get you infected with Aids,"" it would be more efficient. How about we publish an open letter signed by netizens to invite Madam Peng Liyuan to be an ""image ambassador"" in the Aids prevention campaign in Xinjiang? If all of the brothels with names like the washing foot city or the cold drink house were closed and people had a view of life that honored purity this disaster would be controlled. If the government politically intervenes in Aids prevention, makes Aids a very sensitive issue that people can not talk about or even think about, and deals with Aids infected people the way the government deals with the national security issues and the social issues, I think they could completely destroy Aids in the area, otherwise it is hard. Caring about them and not misunderstanding their Aids infection... and blah blah. This doesn't cross my mind at all. Sometimes, I think they would praise this illness if it was transmitted from something better. I think sometimes. Not all the doctors with white coats are angels and there are some devils in hospitals. So, it is really important to find the right doctors and avoid some unknown and uncertified doctors. That is one of the most important measures for preventing diseases. My little sister got a blood infection disease in her elementary school after being given immunization shots by the school. After the inquiry we learned that some doctors from inland China tested some newly invented shots on the students. Who knows then, right? My beloved sister passed away after suffering from the disease for 20 years. Schools open their doors for those conspirators. They don't worry about anything because they have certificates with big stamps. The probability of getting infected with Aids from medical devices is very high and people get infected quickly. So, don't expect mercy or protection from some ladies or some fathers. Let's just be more careful and cautious. All the dirty brothels under the various names must be closed and the owners shot, that is it. The shutdown is one of the ways but the most important thing is awareness of people about this issue. If people's awareness is raised they will naturally avoid those kinds of dirty places. What is supposed to happen to other getting infected with Aids. Even though our senior people over 50 and 60 try to get more wives and our young people are obsessed with having sex with girls. Let's look at ourselves before trying to dig into other people's faults. If only we get Aids but not others, of course there is a reason here to blame ourselves. The topic is about girls when we get together, from the morning to evening in any occasion like wedding and parties. Were we created only for that? The comment is a live issue. There is nothing but male hormones in our talk. A compulsory investigation should be conducted by the attendance of all people including workers, employees, and farmers for finding infected people. The government should take their blood samples and archive them and provide medical care for them separately. What is supposed to happen other getting infected by Aids even though our senior people over 50-60 try to get more wives and our young people are obsessed about having sex with girls. Let's look at ourselves before trying to dig other people's faults. If only we get Aids but others, of course there is a reason here to blame ourselves. The topic is about girls when we get together, from the morning to evening in any occasion like wedding and parties. We were created only for that? In addition to this comment, my suggestion is following: Since the situation is like this, it is not a bad idea to increase sex education while we strengthen the moral education. Is there any other way to keep some people who can not stop some sexual behavior safe other than teaching how to use condom correctly? Anyway, every person will be responsible for what they do in the future. The point is to prevent the disease from being transmitted to others. If the strengthening of moral education worked, this dirty illness would already be diminished. Windboy posted time 14:07 19-10-2015 ...even though our senior people over 50 and 60 try to get more wives. If they are told that it is safe as long as they use condom, would the number of people who have sex without marriage not increase ? Aids would disappear if the authorities paid attention to it as much as they did stability. The China News Agency, December 1st report: According to the news of the United Nations on November 30, just before the World Aids Day, the United Nations called on all its branches to organize different activities to expand the antiretroviral therapy into all the infected groups and achieve an Aids free next generation. The WHO reported on October 31st, that the control of Aids virus transmission in Millennium Development Goal (MDGs) has already has been achieved in advance of the date. This great achievement is highly relevant because of antiretroviral therapy. The WHO indicated that if Aids infected people use antiretroviral drugs immediately after they become infected, there is a big possibility to keep their condition healthy. Also, using antiretroviral drugs prevents onward transmission of HIV and It also recommends offer of pre-exposure prophylaxis to people at substantial risk of HIV infection as an additional prevention choice as part of comprehensive prevention. At the same time, An infected mother can reduce the risk to transmit HIV to a baby if she use antiretroviral drugs. Huge reductions have been seen in death and infection rates when antiretroviral therapy is in use, particularly during early stages of the disease. Since its pick in 2004 until now, the rate of death from Aids reduced 42%. Also the rate of new HIV infections has been reduced 35% since 2000. Antiretroviral therapy especially has been expended throughout Africa and the number of people who received antiretroviral therapy reached 11 million when it was only 11 thousand in 2000. During their global meeting this year, world leaders made a new sustainable development goal. This included the goal to eliminate Aids infection permanently before 2030. To achieve this goal, the number of newly-infected people by HIV should be reduced by 75% of the current totals, and the current number of the HIV-infected people who received antiretroviral therapy (ART) should be doubled in number by 2020, the WHO emphasized.

"Pol Pot, a Stalin from Southeastern Asia Pol Pot, a Stalin from Southeastern Asia He was born to a wealthy peasant family in 1925. In 1949, 20 Cambodian youngsters were offered scholarships from the French Protectorate of Cambodia to study in Paris, France. (At that time, Cambodia was under French suzerainty.) Among them, there was one peasant's son. This youth's name was Saloth Sar, and his later name was Pol Pot. (However, at that time, even his family didn't know Pol Pot was his name. Since 1975, this name, Pol Pot, has become a shocking name in Cambodia.) After Saloth Sar came to Paris, he got in touch with Cambodian students and joined the Cambodian Student Union. During this time, after he studied Marxism and Leninism, he formed his understandings of socialism and communism. In 1950, Saloth Sar founded the Cambodian Communist Party. In 1956, he returned to his country and worked for the French underground anti-colonist movement. Following that, he gained more and more power. In 1976, by overturning the pro-American regime with his armed forces, he became prime minister. Then, the skirmishes that were occurring between the Vietnamese and Cambodians intensified into a war between them. As a result, Vietnam occupied most parts of Cambodia. The Khmer Rouge sentenced him to lifelong imprisonment in 1997. He died due to illness. In 1970, Lon Nol seized the regime from Sihanouk under the American military's support. In 1975, Pol Pot declared unexpectedly his order of starting a revolution. On April 17, 1975, he became prime minister by overthrowing Lon Nol's regime. On June 21, 1975, Mao Zedong met Pol Pot. On January 1, 1976, he announced new a constitution and laws and changed the country's name to Democratic Cambodia. As a result, King Sihanouk abdicated his throne. Then, the Khmer Rouge carried out pure communism, including the separation between private property and capitalism, the elimination of cities, the abolishment of normal martial life (the separation of married couples), the government with full interference in all social life, the establishment of society without the rich and the poor, compulsory labor on collective farms, dining together, and the elimination of religion and private property. And he carried out a socialist cleaning movement to suppress his opponents. At that time, there was no hospital or telegraph station in Cambodia, which caused one million 700 thousand people to die of starvation, war, and various crimes. Among them, there were two hundred thousand Chinese (some material indicated 3 million). Since that time, the name of Pol Pot has become a menace to the citizens. On December 28, 1978, Vietnam announced the invasion of Cambodia. After that, 10 divisions with 200,000 soldiers attacked from seven directions. Cambodians and international society condemned this Vietnamese invasion. In March 1981, the Cambodian Democratic Kingdom was independently established under the leadership of King Sihanouk. In September 1989, Vietnam recalled its army. When international society suggested together establishing a peaceful government, Pol Pot rejected it and expressed his insistent belief in communism. This made the Khmer Rouge isolated. Without international support, the Khmer Rouge was more isolated than before, which caused its life to become worse and worse. As a result, its armies turned into chaos. In addition, the people's living standard difference between Sihanouk's land and Khmer Rouge land rendered hesitation toward Khmer Rouge's rules. Therefore, Pol Pot had no choice but to reform his policies, and he allowed the soldiers to do business and have private properties. In 1993, Cambodia held a general election. But the Khmer Rouge didn't gain any votes because it had already lost people's trust (we all know the reason). In August 1996, the vice prime minister of the Khmer Rouge surrendered to the central government with 3000 soldiers. After Pol Pot was informed that the Khmer's commander-in-chief attempted to surrender to the central government, he executed the commander-in-chief's family, including the commander-in-chief, his wife, and children. The death of the commander-in-chief provoked the army. As a result, the military aimed at <Number One Brother>, and Pol Pot escaped. But he was captured and was sentenced to lifelong imprisonment. After Pol Pot died, Khmer Rouge's parts suddenly started to surrender to the central government. On December 5, 1988, the last part of the Khmer Rouge left the forest to surrender to the central government. Then, the Khmer Rouge was seriously destroyed. The morale of soldiers became low. The death of the commander-in-chief triggered armies' anger, which caused Pol Pot to be captured. On April 15, 1998, he died of heart disease. Four soldiers burned his body by pouring on gasoline after they covered his body with sheets. Hence, in the end, this tyrant's body was not buried. Let us see him if it is possible to provide his pictures. This bad guy was punished by justice. One death is not enough. Ah, this world! This world will reward or punish you based on what you did before. I heard that Cambodians should appreciate Vietnamese. They really should appreciate them. Cambodians stood on the streets in lines to welcome the Vietnamese Army. Our country declared a war on Vietnam in the earlier year. A war following by the shames of international society.

"I think that if our Earthquake Administration had been able beforehand to do a simulation of big earthquakes on this Longmenshan mountain earthquake belt, then on that day of May 12, once the Earthquake Administration had measured the quake at a magnitude of 7.8, we would have been able to broadly judge the extent of damage and destruction in the earthquake disaster zone. If the simulation program was well designed, circumstances like debris blocking roads, heavy rainfall obstructing parachute drops, power and communication outages should all have been within expectations. Instead in this instance the Liberation Army headquarters emergency contingency plan obviously was not a contingency plan designed with earthquakes as the assumed condition, as the soldiers all rushed straight to Wenchuan, without immediately sending out troops in the direction of badly-hit areas Beichuan, Qingchuan and Gansu's Longnan; only 24 hours later was the full extent of the disaster area taken into consideration. In addition, the breakdown in communication also brought a serious problem to the surface.

"Ten women have died near the Libyan coast MP 30 June 2016: In the Strait of Sicily, 32 kilometers away from the Libyan coast, 10 women were found dead in an inflatable plastic boat. On Thursday, 30 June, when Italian coast guards received an emergency call and reached the place, the 10 women were already dead due to suffocation and drowned by water accumulated in the boat among the crowd of more than 100 refugees. The inflatable boat was not suitable for the waves of the sea created by the strong wind. When emergency aid reached there, the boat was half full with water, which was up to half of the height of many people. In total 107 people were rescued from the boat. Italian coast guards continued the search to save others who might have been scattered there.

On Thursday, 30 June, when Italian coast guards received an emergency call and reached the place, the 10 women were already dead due to suffocation and drowned by water accumulated in the boat among the crowd of more than 100 refugees. The inflatable boat was not suitable for the waves of the sea created by the strong wind. When emergency aid reached there, the boat was half full with water, which was up to half of the height of many people. In total 107 people were rescued from the boat. Italian coast guards continued the search to save others who might have been scattered there.

"AIDS is Xinjiang's pain. Adip edited this article at the end. Time 1:21 pm. October 18th, 2015. Maybe some of you might remember, a couple of days ago I wrote an article called ""the most beautiful Chinese woman in Xinjiang"". In this article, I expressed my appreciation toward Song Qing Lin who contributed a lot to Xinjiang soccer development and had been known as a respectful lady all around Xinjiang. 2. At the end of the article, I switched my topic from Xinjiang's soccer hope to Xinjiang's pain AIDS. We strongly expected another lovely and strong Chinese lady to show up in Xinjiang's AIDS Treatment and Prevention field. I was told so. 3. Actually I was thinking about our first lady Ping Liyuan, the wife of our president Xi Jingping, and expected her to do something to provide help for Xinjiang's AIDS field. There was nothing wrong with this dream. There is an old saying in Uyghur that says if the baby cries, mama will feed. Our respected for the first lady Ping Liyuan currently as an important person in AIDS field both nationally and internationally. The fact that the first lady entered Xinjiang could make huge progress in Xinjiang's undeveloped AIDS research problems. If the first lady had publically given a couple of speeches in several Universities of Xinjiang, students from different ethnic groups would be highly touched and encouraged. 5. http://bbs.izdinix.com/thread-65040-1-1.html So this was a topic about the most beautiful Chinese woman in Xinjiang. A lot of people commented on this topic. Yes, AIDS is the same as the voice of society. I hope people observe things in a problem solving way not an emotional way. If licensed massage centered were closed, one transmitted method would be gone. Mrs. Ping Liyuan's speeches might not be totally effective. AIDS transmission ways are completely available. In our society the most important publicity is ""AIDS will not be transmitted if condoms are used appropriately"". If advocate people do no do things that could cause AIDS, maybe some hope will be left for decreasing the number of AIDS patients. Should we write an open letter with signatures to ask Mrs. Ping Liyuan to become Xinjiang's ""Image Ambassador"" for AIDS prevention? The diseases can be controlled if unlicensed massages centers and night clubs are closed, and people start to value chastity and live upon it. I think that if some policies can interference with AIDS that scares people into talking about it or even thinking about it, and see the purposeful transmission as an important problem in Country Security, Human Rights, and Labor, AIDS could be controlled in couple of months. Otherwise, it will be challenging. Care for them, and correctly explain the infection, and so on. I can't think through it. I was thinking that if it was a disease which was transmitted through good things, what else people can do to be happy. Ghosts in white coats are also exist. So don't receive treatments from any available hospitals that you see. Avoid meeting with fake and cheating doctors and hospitals is an important method to avoid new disasters. My little sister in an elementary school died due to Scorbutic from injecting an anti-preventing vaccine. We investigated. Doctors from Mainland China invented this vaccine and put them in experiments. Who can recognize them? My beloved suffered this disease for 20 years and passed away. Schools even opens their doors for this kind of evil scheme. They can do anything, because they are holding government issued licenses. The rate of AIDS transmitting through hospital equipment is very high. Brother and sisters, we can't just childishly expect some lady can help us or protect us. Instead we should take care of ourselves. All dirty places need to be closed, and their bosses needed to be killed. Closing is one thing. But the most important thing is awareness. If people can improve their awareness and not go to those dirty places, they can be closed naturally. If adults around 50-60 years old are thinking about marring four women and young adults are thinking about getting girl friends, infection is easy for sure. Don't always blame other people, lets start to find problems with ourselves. If only we were getting infected with AIDS and not other people, it would be our problems. Girls become a topic as long as we get together, like at weddings, parties... Are we just born for this? If the comment above has feet, it can walk. There are no other words except this. Require all workers, staff and farmers to do AIDS tests and establish an individual network for them. Isolate people infected with AIDS to treat them. If adults around 50-60 years old are thinking about marring four women and young adults are thinking about getting girl friends, infection is easy for sure. Don't always blame other people. Let's start to look at our own problems first. If only we were getting infected with AIDS and not other people, it would be our problems. Girls become a topic as long as we get together, like in the weddings, parties... Are we just born for this? This is my response to this comment: Since our situation is already like this, it is not harmful to strongly advocate using condoms appropriately and safely. What else can we do to help immoral people except this. Every person will be judged based on his/her own faults. But the thing is that we need to prevent the disease from transmission. If we could control this disease based only on moral development, this shit disease would be all gone. Published time 2:07 pm. October 19th, 2015. People aged around 50-60 are also thinking about four wives. It is said that using a condom can prevent transmission, then aren't the immoral things increasing? If AIDS were taken as serious as social stability, it would have been long gone. A telegraph from China Media Network on December 1st: according to news on the United Nation's Website on November 30th, the United Nation systems did a lot of activities on World AIDS day. They asked all people infected with AIDS to learn about ""Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy"" to make sure and to advocate to younger generations to understand this. World Health Department stated on October 31 that a thousand year-old AIDS transmission and prevention goals were accomplished. This great progress has a close relationship with ""Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy"". The World Health Department showed that according to experience, if a person with AIDS quickly uses the antiretroviral medications after an infection, it can play a positive role for this person to stay healthy and also it can decrease the changes of transmission. If people highly infected AIDS use the medication, it can play a preventing role. At the same time, if a pregnant mom who is infected with AIDS takes antiretroviral medication, it can prevent the virus transmitting to her baby. The ""Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy"" helps to decrease the death rate of AIDS patients and also decreases the rate of virus transmission. Since the highest infection rate happened in 2004, the death rate of AIDS infected people had decreased to 42% and infection rate decreased 35% compared to 2000. Especially the ""Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy"" profoundly used in Africa. If 11 thousand people had received this therapy in 2000, and now 11 million people are receiving it. During the World Communication season this year, representatives from all around the world agreed to work cooperatively to accomplished goals which includes getting rid of AIDS completely by 2030. World Heath Department repeated that in order to reach this goal in 2020, the total number of people with AIDS needs to decrease, and people who are receiving Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy need to improve.

People aged around 50-60 are also thinking about four wives. It is said that using a condom can prevent transmission, then aren't the immoral things increasing? If AIDS were taken as serious as social stability, it would have been long gone. A telegraph from China Media Network on December 1st: according to news on the United Nation's Website on November 30th, the United Nation systems did a lot of activities on World AIDS day. They asked all people infected with AIDS to learn about ""Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy"" to make sure and to advocate to younger generations to understand this. World Health Department stated on October 31 that a thousand year-old AIDS transmission and prevention goals were accomplished. This great progress has a close relationship with ""Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy"". The World Health Department showed that according to experience, if a person with AIDS quickly uses the antiretroviral medications after an infection, it can play a positive role for this person to stay healthy and also it can decrease the changes of transmission. If people highly infected AIDS use the medication, it can play a preventing role. At the same time, if a pregnant mom who is infected with AIDS takes antiretroviral medication, it can prevent the virus transmitting to her baby. The ""Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy"" helps to decrease the death rate of AIDS patients and also decreases the rate of virus transmission. Since the highest infection rate happened in 2004, the death rate of AIDS infected people had decreased to 42% and infection rate decreased 35% compared to 2000. Especially the ""Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy"" profoundly used in Africa. If 11 thousand people had received this therapy in 2000, and now 11 million people are receiving it. During the World Communication season this year, representatives from all around the world agreed to work cooperatively to accomplished goals which includes getting rid of AIDS completely by 2030. World Heath Department repeated that in order to reach this goal in 2020, the total number of people with AIDS needs to decrease, and people who are receiving Highly Active Antiretroviral Therapy need to improve.

Recently, people on Wechat complained and argued about both a Turkish singer and the people who spread news about this singer, which made Wechat a battling site. Since yesterday, the comments on Mis Ra Nim web had started to blame Xinjiang TV Station for spreading that news. Everyone has turned their attention to the earthquake, and we have left for there. We criticized our entrepreneurs, but they also left for the affected region this morning. So those complaints have vanished. Following that, we started to blame those who had not reached the site.

But in fact, those companies are helping the victims. Now we've started to blame the people who are on their way to the disaster site.

"I could not publish general reports on Keriye in time because internet access was so poor. Apologies. We arrived at Keriye and continued our trip to the affected area. Recently, our brothers and sisters had used WeChat as their battle field. Since yesterday, they had plenty of time to curse the Turkish singer and his fans. They had time to slander and curse Misranim and other Uyghur websites, and even Xinjiang TV. However, we all made our way to the earthquake-affected area and left for the scene. We were very critical of Uyghur enterpereneurs, but once they were mobilized, we stopped blaming them. We also blamed some other people who did not immediately respond but who informed us that they would arrive to the location by tomorrow. And then we still denounced the companies, even though they provided support to the best of their abilities. Then we started criticizing people who went to the scene. We hoped our brothers and sisters would quickly recover from sickness born of extreme excitement. If Allah will allow us, we will try to report the situation in detail from the scene. I beg our brothers and sisters, the Uyghur ündidar friendship circle, to be covered in flowers of love and unity! Please avoid accusations and complaints. Thanks! We visited some of the residents in the Old Town of Keriye County, where the houses had cracks in the walls. Companies such as Abide and Miras sent humanitarian aid, including food and clothing to the affected people at the scene; in the meantime, they also passed along warm greetings to all our brothers and sisters. On websites, local people were interviewed on the spot. If Allah allows, we will publish the details on our websites as soon as possible. At present, our brothers' moods and mental states are strong. The second station is Achchan Township. Other news on Keriye from Uyghur web visitors: Hello! Dear brothers, today we left from Urumqi in the morning and arrived in Hotan at 9:00 in the evening. We took rescue goods with us that were provided by companies such as Abide and Miras. ,In the meantime, reporters from Misranim, Ana Tupraq, Karwan, Chimbulaq and other Uyghur websites took their microphones with them and went to the affected area. It is a 50-km distance from here. We handed over food and clothes to the affected people together with the companies' representatives. The power level of the earthquake is a 7.3-magnitude, an extremely high number. However, Allah protects our homeland: it was as if a miracle happened. According to the information from the Atchan township government, no casualties were reported, but the walls of houses were cracked. The cause was the epicenter being sparsely populated. In addition, 150,000 mu of pasture was destroyed by the huge mountain slide. 319 farm animals died. Everyone saw pictures of the earthquake on WeChat. Well, those pictures that you saw were taken from the most affected area. In total, there are no more than 10 pictures and all pictures were taken from CCTV and Xinjiang TV: there are no new pictures. However, some web writers published old pictures that were taken of the earthquake that occurred several years ago aspart of an attempt to convince the public that the pictures were taken of this quake. This resulted in a bad feeling among the people. One could only feel the real situation of our people on the actual spot. It was our peoples' poverty in Hotan that led to the considerable donation activities among us. People did not stop making donations until now. Visitors who came to the affected area also spread the news and tried to respond to peoples' feeling. At the moment, I would like to suggest that if someone were to make a donation, or organize a support team, the most needed and necessary things are coal and animal fodder. Because the affected area is close to the mountain, night temperatures can reach levels so low that local people need coal in order to stay warm. In addition, a great number of winter pastures were destroyed; therefore, the livestock and house animals need fodder. If people want to help, their best choice is to send only their representatives. It is difficult to contact the affected people or local officials here, because the affected area is so wide and the population settled so sparsely. If you come here, I want to inform you that it is really difficult to contact the affected people or local officials. In that case, you would not be able to hand over your donations. We are very impressed by our brothers' help and kind responses. Through these deeds, they show their generosity when others need urgent help. But we further suggest that you consider more calmly before you decide to come here. At present, there is already enough food and other daily necessities, even more than they need.....

The emigrants leave because of the conflicts in their home countries, unemployment and bad treatment. The President of South Africa, Jacob Zuma, said that leaders should take responsibility.

"Perhat Tursun Perhat Tursun, I am telling you that I would rather lose than be a man without honor; I am not praising you, Perhat Tursun.

You poured the Tarim River Gandon on my head and why do you challenge the way we, the Uyghur people, praise people? If you do this, who will stay by your side? You treated me as a dervish, so I fear thinking of you as I fear water. I am hospitalized from overplaying Paradox. Perhat Tursun, you are my heart disease. If it is a dim poem, I will understand; but it is a cloudy one. How can he live with himself? I like it. Is there anyone who plays Paradox? Let those of us who are not afraid of being psychopaths play Paradox. I will keep it up. What do we call this, a poem? Uploaded time: 2016-1-5 21:23 by muhlis0998 Is there anyone who plays Paradox?

The last lines of the poem are good and I hope Yarghul's writings will be a success. To readers of Yarghul: Focus on the points that you feel are useless in masterpieces, where the absolute world is, at which you are arriving soon.

Perhaps it's you that she is cursing. Turn away from those to whom you are accustomed and those whom you love. Turn your eyeballs into poisonous arrows and focus on the shameless praises ... Just realize you can learn nothing from us. Plunge into our color, flow into our sounds, bloom from our stings, but forget us utterly for the sake of our values. Yes, it terrified and frightened me. I found myself very lonely, like my aunt, who lived alone in our village. I know poets die early without seeing or enjoying life, but it encourages me to read lines about a bright future. I will be satisfied with lies and betrayals. Come at me stealthily and secretly. Please lift my curved son; pull my light-weight body; burn my last fairy tale... I wonder what would happen if not for my organs standing up in the dark night and my feelings of concern lasting me till January. My hard burden oppresses me, and if there were not someone invisible behind me, life would be a misery... I feel like a surplus gland, yet passionate like the winter birds... I love the world with a somewhat crooked passion... and I believe writing poems in this age is corruptive to hearts...
