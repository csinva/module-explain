my story is about a number of jobs that sort of shaped my life and shaped my whole destiny and it was a couple of jobs i had uh during the ages of twenty to twenty one so the story begins in in uh yes i we yes i was employed back then ok i don't know why you laughed but i'll i'll accept that it's a good sign ok thinking out loud here alright so in nineteen eighty four i was a sophomore at princeton you can laugh at that if you like no alright so in nineteen eighty four i was a sophomore at princeton i wanted to take a year off because i had i had a very bad reputation at school i was drinking a lot getting in a lot of trouble so i wanted to take a year off also i had joined the army to pay for princeton and i was looking at four years of active duty after school and eight years of reserve duty so this was my last chance at freedom was after s you know was taking this year off from school later just for the harper's crowd i did become a conscientious objector and so i got out of the military so and avoided the golf war unlike my fellow r o t c guys which was a good thing alright so but this was before i knew i was getting out of the army this was gonna be my year of freedom i nee i needed to make money though during this year off and a friend of mine i know it's going to seem absurd suggested that i be a model and he took some pictures of me i know i have rings under my eyes that go all the way to the back of my skull and i have no hair but at twenty he had it in his mind that i should be a model so he takes some pictures of me and i must admit i i thought i was ugly but i was vain enough to try it i don't know what i was thinking so i go i look up in the princeton library they had a manhattan phone book and i look up modeling and i choose a modeling agency and i go into new york with these pictures this fellow takes them he says can i hold these overnight i said yes and uh the next morning he calls me come into new york we want to sign you to a contract he'd sent my pictures to the photographer bruce weber who does the abercormbie and fitch and vanity fair however you say abercrombie whatever and uh that this fellow wanted to photograph me so suddenly with this small agency which existed for about a year and then there was a scandal with young female models from minnesota closed down but so suddenly i'm a model and i'm going off to this bruce weber photo shoot and i remember we met early in the morning a bunch of us a bunch of male models and a van and as we're going for to uh the hamptons for this photo shoot it's like six am this one guy looks around he's from texas he goes hey we're all blond you know just it dawned on him sort of uh as kind of interesting and so we get out to the hamptons and we're at this farmhouse and it was like a scene out of christopher isherwood the berlin stories all these blonde boys about ten of us running around doing push ups so that our muscles would swell and in and out of the pool and a big buffet and everything waiting for the light to change and uh so i get my picture taken by bruce weber wonderful guy very talented obviously and he wanted me to uh drop my shorts and i felt embarrassed i didn't think i could do that and so i anyways i hid everything i i wasn't able to expose myself so anyways he took these pictures of me and i have one and i'll uh i'm going to pass it out as a sort of gift for you uh i only have a hundred and fifty of them so if one per table but this is the bruce weber picture of me and uh i was the uh anyway the physique was looking good then and you could see i had hair it's sort of depressing to look at that now i don't know what happened but uh anyway so i ended up in the whitney biennial i like to say to my artist friends uh i've been in the biennial but it was in this picture and uh in the back of this is the thing from my uh nursery school just so you can study that if you like so so pass those around so maybe one per table since there's only a hundred and fifty but so it can get to the back alright so here i am a model and i got several jobs and but at that photo shoot at at bruce weber's farmhouse i met a very pretty girl she was his assistant and she gave me her phone number so about a week later i'm doing my modeling appointments which are called go sees which was made very simple for the models it was go see someone and so this was what they called appoi uh appointments were go sees so i'm on a day of go sees and i found myself in the west village and uh right by cornelia street and i remembered that that girl lived on cornelia street and i my high school love was a girl named cornelia and so suddenly it was all fusing in my mind so i call her and uh i get her roommate and i explain that i'm in the neighborhood and is i won't say her name well i'll say her name cause i can't think of a new one i'll i said is erin home no and i'm her roommate and i said oh i'm right in the neighborhood she said well if you wanna come up and wait for her it was late in the afternoon she should be home soon i go ok so i go up to her apartment and i meet the roommate who was about thirty years old and very beautiful and very exotic to me at you know i was twenty she was thirty and uh she offers me a glass of wine we end up drinking uh two bottles of wine not not only is my life been shaped by uh jobs but also by uh liquor and sex which should appeal to the glenfiddich people so um so we drink some wine we drink like two bottles of wine the first girl never comes home and i end up making love to the roommate which these things happened back then and uh so we're making love and she was older and this was all very intriguing to me and at a penultimate moment the moment before an ultimate moment i said to her i said can i have an ultimate moment i cause i wasn't using a condom this was sort of before the whole condom hysteria and aids hysteria and so everything was more about birth control not you know i i thought of a bad line earlier death control so this was all about birth control and so i said um can i have an ultimate moment and she said of course you can in a very sort of condescending way which was a bad thing to hear right at a penultimate moment because i don't know it de destroyed my confidence as a young lover i thought oh of course you can why didn't i know that and so uh it wrecked my ultimate moment a little some short circuiting  happening but it happened and so i thought i learned a valuable lesson which is you never ask a woman if you can have your ultimate moment you just go ahead and have it you don't ask her unless she tells you beforehand that you know you need to be careful or something so i thought this was the valuable lesson i learned to be a lothario never ask so i go off to europe to be a model because i've done very well i ended up being photographed by this guy named horst and i was in bus stop adds all over new york and fernando sanchez lingerie in a pair of bikinis or something so i go off to europe to milan to be a model but i travel for about a month and a half and i get in a terrible bar fight in paris france and i get my nose broken and my lips split and my skull kneed and everything got really beat up and i was supposed to report to milan milano whatever five days later but my nose was all purple and i thought you know what i wanted to be a writer i thought a writer shouldn't be a model so i'm not going to go to milano and that's not a dignified job so i became a male au pair in paris in the uh montparnasse neighborhood so i uh so that was kind of a good job because that was right near where hemingway would hang out and even pass through the bakery that he used to pass through to get to gertrude stein and so i had my two little charges i think they were like six and three and uh and it was wonderful and i was the only au pair garcon in the whole quarter so i was with all these swedish and german girls and it was even better than being a model and going to cornelia street so i did that for five or so blissful months and then i come back to the states and it's late spring and i go visit some friends at princeton and yet again i get completely drunk and in the next morning i'm lying on the floor of my friends' dorm room and i'm totally drunk and destroyed and debauched and ah oh and i'm lying on the hard floor and the school newspaper comes flying underneath the door there was like a bit of an inch comes flying under the door and opens up to a page to the classifieds as it sort of wafted across the room and it was right in front of me and i looked down and there was an advertisement saying come spend the summer in new hampshire at camp thoreau on an idyllic lake and i thought this is what i need i need to stop drinking i'm only twenty one but i already want to stop drinking i'm sorry glenfiddich people and uh let me go off to new hampshire to camp thoreau that's what i need to do so i go off to camp thoreau and i got the job because i'd been an au pair so i knew how to deal with children i'd been a camp counselor during the summers in new jersey at a day camp so i get the job i go off to camp thoreau and i'm doing pretty well and then a friend of mine sends me lolita which i had never read before which is not the best sort of reading material when there's like twelve and thirteen year old girls running around and completely distracted me in the wrong way and uh so one night i got very drunk as always and ate a some food and the whole next day i was hung over for the whole day had a terrible headache into the night and i was sort of walking around the the camp you know trying to clear my head of this headache that had lasted all day and i see a light on at the uh art counselor's uh cabin and so i go to see her and she's in her she was thirty four and i said do you have an aspirin and she you know gets me an aspirin and i had admired her down by the lake cause i had noticed that you could see some pubis sticking out from the sides and i thought this was a more appropriate target for my affections than these young girls than that that nabokov influence so she gets me an aspirin and we're sort of chatting and right in that moment a bat flies right between us and we both scream you know out in the woods there in new hampshire and i say well maybe if we and it's flying around i say maybe if we turn the lights off i think blats are bl uh bats are blind but if we turn the lights off it'll see i don't know what my reasoning was so i turn the lights off and we wait i turn the lights back on no bat and i felt very much you know oh i really am a woodsman a very much a camp thoreau fellow and right at that moment of hubris as always the bat flies right between us like some sort of mad cupid goes right between us and uh and i turn the lights off again i put my arm around her and one touch leads to another i think blake has a poem about that so anyway uh we end up in bed and i remember the rule that i had learned the year before with with another older woman do not ask if you can have an ultimate moment just go ahead and when you're ready have your ultimate moment you know appropriately perhaps after she may have had one but i don't know if i knew that at twenty one so i had i had two ultimate moments that night it was quite lovely and uh but the next day it turned out i was terribly ill and i ended up having salmonella poisoning because i had been drinking the you know the night before in some bar and ate something off the floor who knows what but um so i had salmonella poisoning ended up in dartmouth hospital and uh the camp year came to an end i never made love with the art counselor again but i you know we parted amicably it was very sweet and i go back to princeton become a conscientious objector i just i sold a novel after senior year i moved to new york to work on this novel and i get a letter from far away uh in the united states and i open it up and it turns out it's a letter from the art counselor and with the letter is a picture of a fifteen month old baby boy with red hair and blue eyes and i'm told that it's my son and nine months of pregnancy fifteen months of his life it was exactly two years ago and i was like oh my god and he looked exactly like i did so sure enough this moment that had begun on cornelia street and of course you can and then you know and then being an au pair and getting a camp job and all this drinking had led to me looking at a a child and i was twenty three now and so i went to where uh they lived and i became his dad and uh it turned out you know all this au pair and counseling had been wonderful training and uh i don't mean to be sentimental but that's why we have the word cause sometimes it happens so i became his dad and um and i have to say it's the best job i've ever had and my son is now seventeen he comes up in two days to be with me for ten days and i see him about every eight weeks and he's a beautiful boy and we've had an incredible father son thing for fifteen years now so that's my story and and it all began with these jobs and somehow ended up there rather beautifully so i'll do a hairy call
 people often ask me how i got the scar on my arm and what happened was when i was fourteen years old i got really sick um and no one could figure out what was wrong with me i was very ill and finally after a week of not getting better my mother took me to the hospital and i after many tests was finally days and days later diagnosed um with a hyper allergy something called stevens johnson syndrome and um once they finally found out what was wrong with me they treated me for it but not before i had spent uh weeks in the hospital weeks blind and mute as well um as being fed by tubes and having to sleep sitting up so that i wouldn't choke on my own saliva my mother in her fashion moved into the hospital to be by my bedside and slept every night in the hospital to take care of me and she wouldn't leave my side and finally when i was released on february first i remember it was a friday um as we were riding home in our car she said i've made a promise to god that um if god delivers you safely out of the hospital that i would go and i would do a penance and i would go to the temple and make an offering to give thanks for delivering my child home safely so i know you're really sick but i'm gonna see if your stepdad can can drive us on sunday to the temple um and i just sort of nodded in my very ill way and i said okay and on that sunday february third my step father and my mother and i drove in our red ford mercury car with the black interior um to the hindu temple and i was very ill i was very very weak and frail and um that was long enough ago i was fourteen a long time ago when they still had the front seat that was a couch seat so my mother wedged me in between um her and my stepdad because you know she wanted to take care of me i was still really sick i could barely hold my head up i i had lost a lot of weight i was so weak that she said you stay in the car i'll do the offering she she went she did the prayers she did the flowers she rang the bell she got the food and they came back in the car and she handed me the squeaky round styrofoam plate with bunch of yellow rice on it and some vegetable curry or whatever it was and off we went back down the highway and i remember thinking what a beautiful sunny sunday it was and i was trying desperately to concentrate on this plate of food and my mother said you know just try and have a couple bites of it just you know it's it's blessed it's from the the puja we did and as i was eating this rice um suddenly i heard a loud bang and i looked up and i can remember the plate flying and yellow rice everywhere like confetti and as the rice came down all i could see was this beautiful blue sky this crystal clear blue sky no clouds no cars no road in front of us no trees no nothing just endless miraculous blue sky and these kind of yellow grains flying all around and then all of a sudden i heard another thud and then i kind of heard and it was us we were flying and then we were airborne i realized and then what stopped our fall was this tree and then we kind of went down further down this embankment and then finally came to a last thud and it was just stillness i kind of strain my neck and i could see my mother to my right and we were all pinned very closely together and my mother had her eyes closed and her mouth open and blood was trickling out of the side of her mouth and to my left my stepfather was saying over and over again this mantra of where are we vijay what happened vijay weren't we driving vijay we were at the temple vijay vijay vijay my mother and from my mother emanated this profound and nauseating silence and i started to scream at my mother i started to say mom are you awake are you awake if you're awake say something say something please if you're not awake i love you mommy i love you if you are awake i love you but please say something and in the back of me screaming was this chorus this nonstop loop of my stepfather almost like that cliche um image uh or track that the you know the cartoons when a bird or a cartoon character is hit on the head and they say where am i what you know what's going on and that was exactly what he was doing and he just kept repeating this and it was all of a sudden i started feeling things i started feeling hot and cold and wet and sticky and itchy and burning and all i could feel from my mother was this silence emanating from her that kept getting louder and louder the silence then i finally heard a man call down to us and say are you okay are you okay i said yes we're alive we're alive please get help please please get help and then a bunch of firemen came and i remember hearing the crunch of their boots down the leaves down the you know on the leaves down the embankment and they came and you know they kind of got i heard chainsaws i heard a helicopter in the distance approaching um i heard blowtorches i would later learn that they had to use these famous things called the jaws of life to cut open the roof of this red ford mercury zephyr and um so you know i got taken to the city of angels and um my parents got taken somewhere else my arm you know because we were pinned so tight my arm had flown across my mother's chest um and so my arm was just shattered in uh many pieces and i lay there for hours and hours not knowing what happened to my parents not knowing if my parents were okay if my mother was alive and i remember being incredibly uncomfortable in a cold hospital bed with glass everywhere in every crevice of my body under my nails in my hair in my ears just shattered glass everywhere and i remember you know in the emergency room i remember vague bits and pieces of what people said like you know well i don't think it's worth doing but you know i question the mobility of that arm or well as the owner and we were home it took us a long time to heal my stepfather broke his uh leg his left leg in four places his hip in two my mother had to come home and still have a hospital bed at home for weeks and months um and we had one to one nursing twenty four hours around the clock at home because of course my mother this time could not care for me could not be by my side indeed she had her own hospital bed but my mother was determined they said that they weren't gonna do any surgery on my arm because they thought it wasn't really worth it that it would probably be dormant be kind of semi lame at my side and you know i was so young i could learn to do everything with my left hand and so my mother was determined not to let this happen and so she from her hospital bed at home ordered me to go to another orthopedist whom she had found on the phone through colleagues and he said well she's so young we should do it and he decided to do surgery on my arm and and i got this very beautiful thin scratch of a surgery incision and there was a cylindrical metal plate that was put on and as my arm got better the scar got worse and you know i was very awkward to begin with and i was feeling you know i was fourteen had all these hormones and feeling off about my body and i knew that the scar on my forearm was looking bad and so i knew what was to come with this scar and so anyway years go by and i had to have multiple surgeries on the arm every time the arm got more and more better and every time the scar got longer and thicker and ropier and darker and you know i kind of found ways to look normal while hiding it you know and um i would go on dates in college and i would have to really think about whether i was gonna wear a short sleeve blouse or a long sleeve blouse and um then i was studying abroad and and i started modeling of all things and you know i wasn't a fancy model i i used it i graduated from college and then i really started modeling to pay off my college loans was a fit model a work a day model um and then this weird thing happened and the agency called me and they said guess what helmut newton wants to shoot you and you know i was uh young and i i was like who's helmut newton they said you know helmut newton the guy he's great he does these beautiful sexy dangerous edgy pictures of women and he wants to shoot you so you know before my agency would you know when they're calling around so they'd get comments like you know she's yeah she's kind of pretty but that scar those same people were calling going can we book the girl with the scar it's amazing that somebody else thinking you're cool can make you think differently of yourself and you know so all of a sudden i was doing all these runway shows you know it was like doing alberta ferretti and her village and all these gray and so my salary got went up and you know all of a sudden i was the girl with the scar so you know maybe this scar was this mixed blessing in a way right cuz it paid off my college loans and you know bought me an apartment paid off my mom's mortgage a lot of cool things so i thought that was great and i was thinking about all of this recently because i found myself um on my back in another hospital bed staring at another white ceiling and i was told that i would probably never have children naturally and that was very upsetting as many women can understand and men too and then i got pregnant which was a real surprise but a happy one um and then i was told it would be a difficult pregnancy and then it was a really difficult pregnancy and i was ordered on complete bed rest the last trimester of my pregnancy and my mother in true fashion moved in with me the next day yeah it's true and you know your mother moves in with you at thirty nine it's a completely different experience but there she was valiant in her nurturing and um you know it it was a very scary uh last few weeks of the pregnancy i wind up going to the hospital more than once before i had the baby and one time for five days with a fetal heart monitor and tubes everywhere and staring at the ceiling and thinking to myself god please get me out of here please deliver me and my child intact and healthy out of this hospital and i recently miraculously found myself again with my mother in another car this time going to flushing queens to another temple but this time to give thanks for the safety and delivery of my daughter thank you
 my mom was a really amazing person uh she was the type of person that could take any mundane life event and turn it into a party in about ten minutes flat uh she was really really into holidays um and she could take our normal suburban pittsburgh house and turn it into all these magical worlds uh and not just for holidays that like everybody decorates for we had a special set of flags that were just for memorial day that were different than the flags that we used on the fourth of july christmas was a really big deal uh we had a tree in every room and every tree had a theme she liked themes i never had a birthday party that didn't have one uh there was the victorian tea party and the fitness birthday party i'm an only child what can i say uh i think she just really wanted everything to be special but growing up like this that also meant that our house had a lot of stuff in it if we're being honest she was a packrat verging onto a hoarder uh she had all the tendencies if she saw something she liked she bought three of them she had all of these materials for projects that she never even started let alone finished she saved everything like normal stuff that parents save like schoolwork but then like old bits of wrapping paper and ribbons she never threw away a piece of clothes um she had two closets and two armoirs just full of her clothing and that was kind of her mo like if you walkd into our house you would never know that she had all of this stuff because it was all tucked away into closets and drawers nooks crannies uh the attic was so full that we weren't even allowed to go in it and it was all christmas decorations so i as much as i loved this celebration like i could just never wrap my brain around the amount of stuff like even as a child i just didn't understand the point of having things that we only use once a year or that she would just buy and forget about so now i'm someone who complulsively cleans uh when i open my own closet and i see something that i haven't you know looked at or thought about for a couple months it like immediately goes to goodwill i'm not super sentimental with things um you know my husband might get me a card and write a little note in it and i'll put it out and then find a way to like quietly get rid of it um so growing up in this house i just you know i could never understand all this stuff um i was just more pragmatic than she ever was she was also really sick uh for my entire life uh we had a lot of holidays in hospitals or when she was bedridden but that never really slowed her down you know she always like dragged herself out of bed got the stuff up and when she passed away when i was twenty five it was sudden but it wasn't necessarily unexpected so while you know my dad and i weren't really prepared for it emotionally we had had a chance to sort of deal with that mentally so that first christmas after she passed away we decided we're gonna do the thing you know we tracked down the decorations we found as many of them as we could we put them all up and we had a whole family over and i i cooked my first turkey all by myself and even though she wasn't there and it wasn't quite the same it felt okay you know this is the new normal we can figure this out and about a year after that i got the phone call from my dad i'm gonna sell the house you know it's too big and i took this a lot harder than your average adult does it was the only house that i had ever lived in my entire life from when i was born until i went away to college i just couldn't imagine a world in where i wasn't going back to that house but despite my hesitations this is what's happening so i go home to help him clean out the house and immediately it is just stuff overwhelm i mean there is twenty years worth of stuff here that nobody has ever really gone through and i live in brooklyn in an apartment what am i gonna do with a formal dining room table and like eight chairs that are so heavy i can barely lift them let alone an entire attic full of christmas decorations and it immediately just made me feel like a pretty terrible daughter because i knew the expectation was that i was supposed to keep all of this stuff that somehow one day i was gonna have my own house and i was gonna fill it up with the stuff and our lives were just really different that was never gonna be my thing so i'm standing there having this moment in the house looking at this dining room table and my dad says to me you gotta go clean out the closet in the bedroom in my house for my entire life this specific closet was always called the closet that eats everything and it was called this because if you lost something in my house no matter where this item originated from it wound up in this closet like that room in harry potter where all the missing stuff goes uh it was like a series of pneumatic tubes like would connect to the garage and the kitchen and no matter where this item originated it wound up in this closet i'd be like lose a shirt and i'd be like mom have you seen my shirt oh well did you check the closet that eats everything no mom why would it be in there and she's like open the door and pull out the shirt is this the one you're looking for just happened more times than i could count but the real reason that i was anxious about going into this closet was because it was also where we kept all of the family photos and the scrapbooking materials so i made a plan i was not going to engage with any of the stuff i was just going to sort the stuff because nostalgia is the enemy of all successful cleaning expeditions so family photos keep one pile uh old unsent greeting cards throw away another pile and that lasted for about five minutes before i'm knee deep in the family photos going through every single one of them and i'm looking at pictures of us you know around that ugly table thanksgiving and a bunch of s you know six year old girls in puffy dresses having a tea party and photos of christmas trees that were so beautiful that they could have been in magazines and all that stuff started to get really real again and that is when i noticed this box it's just a normal cardboard box it looked kind of new so my first thought was like oh my god here's another thing that she bought that she didn't even know that she had but i picked it up and the contents inside were like shifting a little bit and it was heavy so i opened it and i look down and it is a box of greeting cards okay so she got the guy at hallmark to give her the overstock for some reason you know but then i noticed them and none of them have any envelopes i thought that was weird so i picked up the first card and it was a first birthday card it was my first birthday card it said to morgan on it and when you opened it up it had slots inside of it where you're supposed to put pennies from the year that the baby is born and all of the nineteen eighty three pennies were still in there so i keep digging though this box and there's more first birthday cards and there's cards from christmas and halloween because who gives greeting cards on halloween and thanksgiving and birthdays and valentine's day and cards that i have received just because or because we had a fight and it dawns on me and as a parent that this entire box is every single greeting card that was ever exchanged between me and my mom and my dad from the time that i was born up until the fairly recent past and i just did not undertand this box and it made me really angry and upset because i there was obviously something that i was supposed to know about this box something that she knew she was saving these things for a reason but i didn't know what it was and now all of a sudden here's this box of memories that i am confronted with this is what i was so worried about losing in the house but now they're my responsibility and before i knew it my whole body just started sort of reacting without me and i panicked and i started to throw everything away just ripping things and throwing them and i am weeping and that's how my dad found me was like in a pile of greeting cards you know surrounded by stuff so i tell him about the box and we start to sort of calmly go through it and he picks up a card and he looks at it and he says i remember getting this birthday card i had it on my desk for a while and then i threw it away i specifically remember throwing this card away so now we have this moment where we're laughing together at this image of my mom like digging through the trash to save greeting cards and it just dawned on us that we're never gonna know the answer to this mystery that she's gone and i'm looking through cards and i see cards that i signed my name to but that i don't remember buying and cards that have my name on them but that i don't really remember getting and without her without her logic and her magic they were just stuff they were just her stuff the the box the cards they weren't my memories to save they were her memories and she had just saved so much stuff that none of it was really special anymore you know to me that the most special thing about this box was that she had cared enough to save it in the first place and that i got to experience that one more time so we each took a few things and ultimately we decided we could let it go we could get rid of the rest of them we took them to the recycling bin and the next day i went back to new york and i never set foot in that house again but i had this new sense of calm about the whole thing and uh in the back seat with me on my drive was a box of christmas ornaments and a card full of nineteen eighty three pennies
there're some scientists who say that the universe that we inhabit is not the only universe there is there are alternate universes they say that these universes arise from the sub atomic realm of quantum physics here's how they say it works every time a quantum event happens it produces all of its possible results this is like saying if you flip a coin it comes up heads but it also comes up tails since those two results are mutually exclusive the flipping of the coin splits the universe into two alternate universes the heads universe and the tails universe and since quantum events are happening all the time it means that alternate universes are bubbling up continually they're always being created splitting off from ours and these alternate universes are real they're not just figments of the imagination they're complete whole real things i know this is true because i experienced an alternate universe i was driving in my volkswagen van up to a tai chi camp in upstate new york a couple of summers ago um i bought the volkswagen van when i'd quit my job a few years previously i bought the van um because i quit the job as a custom database application engineer this was not a job that i really had intended to become when i was a kid that's not what i thought i was going to be uh it's just sort of the job i happened into and i always thought of it as the work i was doing before i was gonna find my real work but when i got close to about forty i suddenly thought oh my god this could be it this could be what i end up doing this could be on my tombstone tom wiser custom database application engineer wrote well optimized queries many customers satisfied and i thought no that that can't be it that can't be all there is and i quit the job without really knowing what i was going to do next and and and i knew that what i should do was to take my skill set and to make a lateral move to a career path that was more appropriate but but i i i really didn't wanna do that i didn't wanna be so logical i actually wanted something more magic i i wanted to be like the guy in the fairy tale that trades the cow for the magic beans and and i know that that's a bad deal i know that the cow's a better investment the cow's gonna pay off in the long term but but but but if the magic beans work out you're in a whole new story so so so i quit the job and i bought a volkswagen pop top camper van and i drove around country and what i thought is ok i'm not going to make a lateral move i am going to drive around the country and i'm gonna open myself up to whatever may come and then what i'm going to do is going to arise organically i'm gonna find my next path there by the side of the road in arizona i'm gonna pick it up and bring it back to new york so i drove around the country twenty five thousand miles eight months and when i got back to new york i had no clue i really didn't know and and it left me very vulnerable to the new york question the first question anybody asks which is so what do you do i didn't know i had i had a i didn't have a good answer and it made me feel really embarrassed because everybody knows what they do everybody does and i thought i should too so when i was driving the volkswagen van up to tai chi camp the other summer i i felt very relieved because in camp i know what i do i do the camp thing i do what's at camp and i don't know if you know this but there are a lot of camps for adults that are out there i i found them when i was driving around the country uh there are tai chi camps and yoga camps and and bird watching camps there's even a camp where you can dress up in armor and joust all the things that that give us joy and that we tend to demean with the name hobby those are the things that are that are celebrated in camp and when people go to camp they are so lit up they are finally getting to do that thing the thing they love it's like yes i finally get to joust i don't have time for that anymore really so i was going up to camp and feeling pretty good about it and i decided on the way i would stop into ithaca i heard that it was a a kind of a neat town so i i pulled off the highway into ithaca and um it's on the southern shore of lake cayuga there's flatland and these hills and it has a a very particular microclimate there which allows hippies to survive all the stores have names like it takes a village or hemp unlimited and and and the and the children are all completely multiethnic and only wear cloth organic diapers it was it was really something i drove around like sort of like disney hippie land just watching it and then i drove up the hill up toward cornell which has these stately buildings on the hilltop and and as i drove onto the campus i had this stabbing sensation and i suddenly was pierced with a vision of an alternate universe my alternate life i thought oh my god i was supposed to go to cornell if i had gone to cornell i woulda studied animal behavior and right now i'd be a professor of evolutionary biology i'm a professor of evolutionary biology and i've got a wife she's got dark hair she's really smart and i'm a professor with a wife and we've got two kids they like to sing it was this completely realized vision of this alternate life and it looked so good alternate ithaca tom he'd made these great choices it was really working out and and i drove around in a in a kind of a wash of nostalgia for this life that i hadn't had wow there's the human ecology center i did all my grad work there and there was this funky cottage that i used to live in when i had six roommates and we had a chore wheel and ate brown rice and and there was these gorges that we used to do drum circles in and songs to the goddess and it was and and there was this woman that looked just like my wife would have looked when i would have met her i was overwhelmed by it i couldn't stand to stay there any longer i i drove off the campus i fled ithaca and and flew to tai chi camp but alternate ithaca tom came with me now now at camps i tend to uh really b have a good time i i laugh a lot i joke a lot especially in tai chi camp with the residents are kind of serious and slow moving uh i i can't help but kinda tease them and and in this particular camp uh the teacher said that we were going to be meditating every morning from seven to eight and she was looking for a volunteer someone a musician that would wander the hallways um playing an instrument or singing to wake up the residents uh i'm not a morning person and so i thought oh so i have a choice here either it's gonna be six thirty i'll be lying in my bed really grumpy while some asshole sings outside my door or i could be the singing asshole for the rest of that week i was the singing asshole of the camp every morning i would i would roam the halls singing lustily waiting waking up all of my fellow tai chi players and i and and the the people there saw me laughing and singing and they said tom it's really great to have you here you're so happy you're such a happy guy and i thought yeah you think i'm happy but you haven't seen alternate ithaca tom i've seen him he's happy and and the fact that he was so much happier than me was making me miserable and i kept looking at everybody else's life and and comparing myself to them and i remember having lunch with a a woman who was in her sixties and she was a calligrapher and she was about to have her first grandchild she was really excited and i thought maybe calligraphy that that could be it and and then there was this other guy he had studied tai chi when he was in his twenties and now he was a sales rep at dell and i thought dammit if i had studied tai chi in my twenties maybe i could be a sales rep at dell now i've never wanted to be a sales rep but i was i was just getting carried away that feeling that i was in the wrong life i was in the wrong place i couldn't shake it i i really tried to absorb the lesson of tai chi which is to be present just relax accept what's coming to you and be present here but i thought yeah yeah that would be easy it's so much easier to accept where you are if only you're in the right place well eventually camp was over and i i left i drove back to new york and as i was driving over the george washington bridge i could still hear alternate ithaca tom he was hanging around me haunting me like a ghost and i thought oh god i need professional help so i made an appointment with the family psychic this is the guy that's done readings for all of my siblings and my cousins and i went to see him and he's an astrologer so he did out my chart and this time he was very interested in this polarity that he saw he said you have saturn in the midheaven and this marks you as a person who could be very organizational the organizational man the hierarchical one uh the corporate guy the dad the provider not particularly sexy but a straight up guy on the other hand there's pisces and the sun and they they're they're uh they're squared with each other you can't resolve them pisces and the dreamer the mystic the guy that's the artist never quite pinned down never quite in a relationship and and you have to balance these two you you have to chose one or the other and and and normally i love to hear this kind of thing this is the great thing about going to a psychic is that for an hour they just talk about me its its so interesting but this time i was so caught up with alternate ithaca tom i couldn't really appreciate it all so i i just blurted out what had happened to me and i asked him what does this mean and the psychic said wow this represents a fundamental choice that you've made in your life you could have been the hierarchical guy but you chose to be the piscean if you had decided to be an academic you would have been very successful there's no doubt that the university structure would have raised you up you probably would be married have kids i thought aw shit alternate ithaca tom made the right choices but the psychic said if you had become an academic your wife would have had an affair with your brother or your best friend alternate ithaca tom is crushed he's just found out that his wife is having an affair with his research partner this is the guy he's been working with for fifteen years it's a long term affair they're they're moving in together she's taking the kids uh he's completely crushed poor alternate ithaca tom he he starts drinking he can't keep his lecture notes together he can't keep his research together he's coming up for tenure and it's all falling apart and in the midst of his turmoil he's suddenly pierced by this vision of himself driving a volkswagen van he's off to camp uh s uh it's a tai chi camp he's he's not married he he doesn't have kids he doesn't even have a job he's completely free it looks so good this image it pierces him to his heart begins to hang around him and to haunt him like a hungry ghost
 i've always been an adrenaline junkie i love driving fast in my car i love zipping through the woods in my my snowboard my skis and i really love backflipping my bmx bike but what i hadn't really experienced was flight it was something that i had always been interested in but hadn't had a lot of experience with and specifically helicopter flight i always thought that was the most awesome craft to pilot being quick and light and nimble and when i saw an ad in the westford paper announcing an introductory offer for thirty minutes of sightseeing and thirty minutes of instructional time i felt like it was speaking directly to me so i called them up immediately and set my appointment and for the next few days i was extremely excited for that day so when the day came i got to the office early i'm never early for anything but i was early on this day and i'm walking into the office and i look over and i see a motorcycle in the shadows this really cool looking motorcycle and i remember thinking these are my people so i go in i sign my name i go out with the pilot we look at the helicopter we get inside butterflies are going i am so pumped it's time i'm gonna fly this thing i got my own set of controls he has his own set of controls we got our little lap belts on get our headsets on and then the pilot points over at this fire exting fire extinguisher and he says i need you to promise me something and i'm gonna promise you something too if you are on fire i promise i will put you out okay so i say back to him if you are on fire i promise i'll put you out he gives me a high five we started up the main rotor blade starts spinning and we just lift off the ground he just takes us right up and it's got a glass floor i'm looking at it and it's it's like jumping my bike but never coming down we just continue to go up and up and i am so stoked we're flying around and you wouldn't believe just out past the dirt roads it is like an african savannah a safari you just see things that you would never see or realize are just out there past the city we get up and i see this herd of deer and it's so beautiful they're like running cause they hear the helicopter and they're in a big pack and they're looking over their shoulders and we're flying above them and i'm just like how cool is this nobody would ever get to see this and so then he zips into this little this empty river bed and then just starts gunning it through this river bed like fifteen twenty feet above the ground and i'm loving it there's trees on either side of us and we're just zipping winding through it and i'm just like this is so cool i i say to him dude you need to get an awesome stereo system in this thing man you could just rock out and he looks over at me and all like yeah yeah this is good right and i'm just envisioning this i'm having this whole fantasy in my head i'm like i'm gonna get one of these some day i'm gonna have my own helicopter i'm gonna tint the windows i'm gonna paint it like a dragonfly i'm gonna put a sweet stereo system in this thing people are gonna be looking up in the air like hey there's brian look at him so i'm just in this fantasy world just so stoked we're just hauling ass around i love it and then he comes up out of there and he says alright play time's over business time time for you to learn a little bit anybody that's gonna be a real pilot needs to know this it's an emergency drill it's in our rotation basically i'm gonna cut the power it's like putting your car into neutral going downhill main rotor blades gonna keep spinning but there's gonna be a big drop in altitude at the beginning you like elitches rides and you know rollercoasters that kind of stuff you got a soft stomach or are you pretty tough i'm like i'm i'm good with that i'm i'm cool he's okay okay cool cause if you have a problem just let me know i'll land and you can hurl okay cool bases are covered let's do this so sure enough he kills the power whoo we get that like thirty foot drop just instantly in altitude i feel the dr upward draft of the the air and we just kinda come into like this soft slow drift and i'm getting a feel what he's saying you can do if you have an emergency uh landing situation then i start looking at him he's fidgeting with stuff he's turning things he's got a stressed look on his face i'm just like everything alright he looks at me with wild eyes like this the real thing man i i i can't believe it i look out i look down it's like a model railroad set these tiny little trees and my first thought is we're gonna die we are going to die i i signed up for this i paid money to die like you've you've gotta be kidding me a and i'm just watching and we're slowly starting to fall towards the earth and i cannot believe this is happening i'm just like this is a bad joke right like when's the cameras gonna come out and he's gonna smile and say just kidding but he doesn't he's just doing like s turns and figure eights and i'm just thinking i i didn't i didn't i never expected that this would be my last day and i start having these crazy thoughts like i put in some pictures to get developed who's gonna ever see those who's gonna get my car like it's parked down there and who you know i'm just i i can't believe that this is the day we're gonna die there's just no other way around it this you don't walk away from a helicopter crash and so he starts he starts looking like he may be able to land this thing we're coming down towards the ground and and i now my my mind starts to shift from were gonna die to we're gonna get really warped we're gonna hit the ground and it's gonna suck i'm gonna be laying there with a broken back like i just it's like i wear more pads when i'm riding my bike i've got a helmet and knee pads i've got a little lap belt and this little headset and we're in like a glass box i'm just like we're definitely gonna get warped so admit it to yourself the next hour's gonna really suck you know and so here we go we're coming in for a landing we're coming in about a ten twelve degree angle he's doing good he's got us going about fifty miles an hour straight towards the ground and he just yells to me he's like we're gonna hit and and i just did the only thing i thought seemed right i just shut my eyes i took a deep breath i put my arms out in front of my face and sure enough we hit the ground and we just four by four across the prairie just like you know bouncing across the the the the gopher holes and then the left skid digs into the ground and it makes us stop instantly and we just jerk forward and then the main rotor blade is just going super fast it hits the ground and it just cartwheels the whole helicopter and it smashes and breaks it right off behind our heads and we come to a stop looking at the sky and there's just smoke and i can smell jet fuel and the flight manuals are all scattered around inside the the cockpit and i just shoulder the door and jump out and my feet touch the ground and i just can't believe it i'm just like yes and i look up and i'm just like oh my god we were just up that high and now we're here and i have just like a tiny cut on my pinkie it's like and i'm just astounded that this has just happened and then i look at the pilot and he comes around the corner from his side and he's just like i am so sorry dude i am so sorry and i'm just like thank you you did it you landed it and he's like i am so sorry brian and i'm like thank you and it goes on and on like this and i'm just i'm beside myself i cannot believe it i'm like i'm fine and then he just i he turns into a stress case his hands are his head's in his hands he's just like oh my god i am so dead faa's gonna have to make a full investigation there's a nine thousand dollar deductible we just rebuilt the thing oh god we gotta go find help let's go so off we go we just go walking across the prairie and i'm just like  a pie in the sky just like oh wow this is crazy wait till i tell my friends about this one and he's stressed the whole walk and then we see a truck come rumbling down the dirt road we're like hey we wave down this truck we hop over the the uh the fence we flag these guys down they've got a cb in their truck they call the paramedics the cops literally within minutes it's like every single emergency vehicle within a tri stat tri state region is coming over the hill ambulances firetrucks cops four wheelers everybody wants to see what's going on a helicopter crash and people lived what so it's crazy you know the the paramedics insist that i'm in shock and i'm injured i had to have gotten hurt i'm just not feeling it yet even though i've walked miles to get here i'm like i'm fine you know i i crash on a regular basis on my bike i'm i'm good i know when i'm hurt but they insist on taking me to the hospital and checking me out and giving me an iv of saline and so i'm laying there and i get interviewed by the news and my phone is blowing up and it's just an insane day and i can't believe it i'm like it's a dream and i just go home and i'm i'm just like what and i'm laying in bed that night and i just i'm laying on my back my head's on my pillow and i shut my eyes and i still feel like i'm falling i still feel like i'm slowly drifting to the earth and i'm like you know i i think i'm gonna still live boldly i'm gonna still go fast in my car i'mma still jump my bike and do crazy stuff but i don't think i need to learn how to fly a helicopter thank you
 in two thousand eight i was one of those young people who became obsessed with barack obama i i was a senior in college at the time and after i graduated i drove out to ohio and i worked on his campaign and after the campaign i drove to washington because hope in change and two years later the white house actually hired me they hired me to write speeches and people would hear about my new job and they would say wow you must be really good and i would say i dunno i hope so and they thought i was pretending to be humble but i was entirely sincere eh it's not that i didn't think i had any talent whatsoever i it's just that i knew there are three hundred million people in america a and some of them are babies but a lot of them are adults a and it just seemed unlikely that i was the best we the people could do so every day i walked through the gates of the white house absolutely sure somebody had made a mistake and while this was going on my friends and family were equally sure they now had direct access to the president of the united states like i i'm sitting in my white house office and i get a text from my sister rebecca and it says how come the department of homeland security doesn't have a mailing address now even in the best of circumstances this is a disturbing question to get from a family member but if you work in the white house you wanna know the answer to this kind of stuff and i have no idea and it's like this with everything i mean suddenly everyone has a law that only i can get through congress everybody everybody has a a a something wrong with obamacare that i need to know about mostly everybody has the same question they all wanna know have you met him yet have you met obama yet and i say no i haven't met him yet and i get this look and it's a look i soon learn means you may be twenty four years old and working at the white house but you're still a disappointment to your family and friends and i have to say i totally get it i mean everybody thinks that the white house is either like the tv show the west wing where everyone's hanging out with the president or it's like the tv show scandal where everyone's having sex with the president but if you're looking for for a hollywood analogy the white house is like the death star um what i mean by that is just that there's thousands of people that that run around the hallways they're all just trying to make sure their little bit of their job works well and just because darth vader is the public face of the organization it doesn't mean that every storm trooper gets personal one on one time so i try to explain this whole death star thing and it doesn't work i still get that disappointed look and frankly nobody's more disappointed than i am i i mean nobody wants me to meet the president more than me and there's two reasons for this the first i is kind of corny but it's true i moved to washington because i thought i don't know what it is but there must be something i can do for my country i i wanna be the kind of person where the president of the united states is just a little bit better at his job because i'm in the room and the second reason is i would really like barack obama and i to become best friends and now now i'm not saying that every white house staffer imagined that they would become buddies with the president i i'm just saying that none of us ruled it out like you would hear these stories you know somebody got a a fist bump in the hallway or someone else got invited up to play cards on air force one a and the moral was always the same any moment could be the moment that changes your life forever now my first chance at a life changing moment came in november two thousand eleven when i was asked to write the thanksgiving video address i will say upfront if state of the union is all the way on one end of the presidential speech writing spectrum happy thanksgiving america is kinda on the other side but as far as i was concerned this was the most important set of words barack obama would ever say a and so i threw myself into this i mean i i wrote and i rewrote and i made edits and then i made edits to the edits a and finally the day of the taping came and i went to the diplomatic room which is one of the most beautiful rooms in the white house it has this wraparound mural of nineteenth century american life and the advice i always got was you have to act like you've been there before so so i'm standing there tryinna act like i've been there before and the woman behind the camera takes one look at me and goes this is your first time here isn't it and i crack immediately i'm just like yes i have never been here before please help me and she says don't worry she explains her name is hope hall she films the president all the time she's gonna take care of everything all i have to do is wait so i wait and i wait and i wait and i wait a and just when i'm wondering is this whole thing a nightmare is it a practical joke somebody gets an email on their blackberry and they say okay he's moving and then there's kind of a crackling in the air and a minute later president obama enters the room and he's standing up so we all stand up and he sits down so we all sit down and he looks at the camera to start taping when hope stops him and she says uh actually mr president this is david this is the first video he's ever written for you and president obama looks at me and he says oh how's it going david i had exactly one thought in that moment i did not realize we were going to have to answer questions and i have literally no idea what i said after that i i mean i actually blacked out like i went home for thanksgiving and my family was like so have you met him yet and i was like yeah and they were like what did he say and i was like how's it going and they were like what did you say and i was like i don't know i blacked out and i get that disappointed look a and i can't blame anybody because if i'm gonna be the per kind of person who makes the president a little bit better at his job when i'm in the room i am going to have to deal with questions more complicated than how's it going and at the moment there's no indication that i can do it but i make a promise to myself i i say if i ever get another shot at a life changing moment i am not gonna let myself down and i didn't know if it would ever happen for me but in fact it happened just a couple weeks later uh i was sitting in my office i got a phone call from the chief speech writer at the time a guy named jon favreau and he called me up and he said betty white is turning ninety years old and nbc is doing this special where different famous people wish her a happy birthday in these thirty second skits and you're pretty funny and no one else wants to do it wanna give it a shot and i said absolutely and again i understand state of the union is over here and happy birthday betty white is over there but this was my gettysburg address and so we had one week to make it perfect we started off jon and i came up with a joke for the president we were gonna have him fill out a birthday card and then while uh he was filling it out you would hear his voice on a voice over say dear betty you're so young and full of life i can't believe you're turning ninety in fact i don't believe it please send a copy of your long form birth certificate to sixteen hundred pennsylvania avenue washington dc so we feel good about the joke but but we still need a birthday card so uh one day that week i go to cvs near the white house it's a half block away i grab a birthday card that i think is gonna be pretty good and then right when i'm about to leave i realize we don't actually need one birthday card we need two identical birthday cards because we have two different camera angles we don't want anyone to know that the president has already written his birthday greeting and i think yes this is how white house staffers are supposed to feel i mean i've i've saved the day a and so i i walk back to that to that hallmark rack and i i get an identical card and i ring it up and i go back to my office and i'm feeling really good a and then the last thing we need we need some way to end the video and so what i come up with is we're gonna have the president put in headphones and then he'll listen to the theme song from the golden girls which is betty white's most popular show so i find the perfect pair of headphones that go over the ear they'll look great on camera a and i listen to the golden girls theme song on repeat just to get in the mood and then finally on friday i get the call come on over now here's what they don't tell you about having a meeting in the oval office when you have a meeting in the oval office you do not just walk into the oval office the first thing you do you wait in this kind of windowless chamber i it's a little like a doctor's office except instead of last year's marie claire magazine they have priceless pieces of american art and instead of a receptionist they have a man with a gun who in a worst case scenario is legally obligated to kill you it turns out this little room is the perfect place to second guess every life choice you have ever made a and so i'm i'm sitting there with hope hall the videographer and i'm just thinking do i remember how to explain the joke are are both of the birthday cards in there i check my my pants pocket are the headphones still there are the headphones still there are the headphones still there i i'm on the verge of a nervous breakdown when finally one of the president's aides pokes her head out and says okay he's ready for you go on in to my credit the first time i enter the oval office i do not black out i can remember this very clearly right in front of me i i can see a painting of the statue of liberty that was done by norman rockwell that someone has told me is valued at twelve million dollars and behind me out of the corner of my eye i can see the emancipation proclamation not a photocopy of the emancipation proclamation the emancipation proclamation and i can feel the message that this document is sending through the room and that message is i'm here cause i freed the slaves what are you doing here and i look i look across the desk at the president and i realize he may also be wondering what i'm doing here but i feel great i mean i've spent an entire week just practicing how to explain this one joke to the president so so i step up i i look at him a and i open my mouth and what comes out is like i'm trying to ask for directions but in spanish like like the nouns and the verbs are there but there's nothing in between them i i just say betty white video nbc very funny everybody laughs esta bien and and the president gives me kind of a confused look and hope the videographer jumps in a and and explains everything and rescues me but i'm a little concerned because i am here to show the president how professional i am and in my professional opinion we are not off to a great start still i i'm not that worried because i have that second birthday card in my pocket and so i'm gonna get a chance to show president obama how i save the day a and as soon as hope is finished filming even i am surprised by how confident i sound when i walk up to the desk and i put my hand down and i say mr president i'm gonna need to take that birthday card and replace it with this identical birthday card because we don't want anyone to know you've already written your birthday greeting and president obama looks up at me and he says we're we're filming this from all the way across the room and i say yes that's right and he says so no one's gonna see the inside of the card and i say yes that's right and he says so i can just pretend to write in the card we don't actually need another one and i say yes that's right and i put the card back in my pocket and it's strike two but i'm not giving up yet cause i made that promise to myself a and besides i really do feel good about the the ending with the headphones a and so the moment hope is done filming her second camera angle i i walk back up to the president and i reach into my pocket and i pull out what looks like a hairball made out of wires i i don't really know what happened i guess somewhere in that waiting room i have just worried this thing into a hopeless tangle and now i don't know what to do so i just hand the entire thing to the president of the united states now if you work in the white house you will hear the phrase there is no commodity on earth more valuable than a president's time which i always thought was a cliche until i watched barack obama untangle headphones for thirty seconds while looking directly at me and he untangles and untangles and when he finishes he looks at hope and just goes pff shoddy advance work and he does it in this way that lets you know that a he's only joking and b he is not even a tiny bit joking a and i'll tell you my heart just sinks i i mean i this was my third chance to make a second first impression on the president and i let myself down a and all i wanna do is get out of there a and president obama says something like well would it be funnier if i bob my head in time to the music and i say yeah that would be funnier but my heart isn't in it i mean i know i don't belong there and the president looks into the camera to tape this final scene and then suddenly he stops and he says well wait a second if i'm gonna bob my head in time to the music i need to know how the music goes does anyone here know the golden girls theme song and president obama looks at hope and hope doesn't say anything so i look at hope and hope doesn't say anything so president obama looks at me and suddenly i know exactly what i can do for my country and so i'm standing there in the oval office with the emancipation proclamation right behind me and i look our commander in chief in the eye and i say bum bum bum bum thank you for being a friend bum bum bum bum bum bum bum bum travel down the road and back again something something you're a pal and a confidant bum bum bum bum but he looks kind of amused so i keep going i'm like and if you threw a party invited everyone you knew a and that's when he gives me a look that's like okay president's time but it works president obama bobs his head in time to the music and betty white gets her card and nbc gets their special a and i leave the oval office that day with my head held high knowing that the president of the united states was just a tiny bit better at his job because i was in the room and people still ask me after that they still say have you met him yet have you met obama yet and i can finally say yeah actually i have and then just to myself i think not to brag or anything but technically i'm thankful he's a friend thank you very much
i grew up a uh a huge fan of of the new york yankees which when i was very small involved going to games maybe once a year with my my father and my little brother watching uh reggie jackson and a little bit older watching uh dave winfield and then when i kind of came into my teens uh don mattingly who was you know my absolute favorite player and as i i went to high school in new york and it was kind of a turning point the first time that i went to a yankee game by myself and i started going to yankee games by myself and it was at one of these games in the fall of nineteen ninety one that i went up to the stadium bought a ticket to the bleachers and went and sat in the bleachers and was watching um the game and noticed for the first time something that i'd i'd been to the stadium so many times before but i'd never seen uh this kid in right field wearing a yankee uniform who was a bat boy playing catch with the right fielder and i'd never noticed the bat boy before and this kid could not play catch for his his life he was throwing the ball over jesse barfields had the right fielder and he was one hopping him and i was like ya know i i'm not a   athlete but i can play catch at least at least as well as this kid can and i don't understand why he has you know that job and and i couldn't and so i went home that night and i tore a page out of the program that listed all the different you know yankee executives and i wrote a hand written letter to everyone from steinbrenner on down to stump merrill who was the manager at that point and basically said ya know my name is matt and i'm sixteen years old and i'm a huge fan of the yankees and you know i don't know if you can apply for this bat boy position but if you can i really would like an application and i'm so excited to hear from you that if i don't hear from you soon i'm gonna follow up with with a phone call so i sent these off and about two weeks went by and after you know two weeks i hadn't heard anything and so i picked up the phone and the s s yankee switchboard number was on the same list of executives and secretary answered the phone hello new york yankees and i said hi this is matt mcgough and i sent a letter in a couple weeks ago 'bout applying for a bat boy position and nobody got back to me so she's like ok well i'll take your name down and i'll have somebody get back to you and she took took my number down and another week goes by and i don't hear anything so i pick up the phone again and i call and this woman answers the phone hello new york yankees and i say hi this is matt you know i sent some letters in about the bat boy position and i called last week and somebody was supposed to call me back but you know i thought it was kind of rude that that they hadn't and so she you know she laughed and she asked me how old are you and i said sixteen and she laughed some more and i didn't really understand what she was laughing at but you know she took down my name again she said you know um i'll make sure that somebody gets back to you so you know a few days later sure enough in the mail um a letter arrived on on yankee letterhead official letterhead and it invited me to come up to the stadium for an interview with nick priori who's the clubhouse manager so i put my jacket and and tie on i don't even think i told any of my friends about this cause it was way way too weird to explain so i went and took the four train up to the stadium and walked into the you know walked around the stadium and this is october so they weren't playing in the world series in october back in ninety one so it was very very quiet and i walked around the stadium and walked into the yankee lobby and there's this security guard there and i introduce myself and i say i'm here for the bat boy interview and he picks up the telephone and he's like you know nick some kid's here to see you and you know ok i'll and so he says you  know have a seat so i sit down in in the pinstripe lobby and i'm you know passing about ten minutes waiting for this guy nick to come up for the first job interview of my life for the first job of my life and i'm you know trying to think of the questions that he might ask me so i'm ready to uh tell him what my favorite subject is in school and tell him you know why i think the yankees need a big bat behind mattingly you know to win the pennant next year and what you know mickey mantle's batting average was in nineteen fifty six and like all these different questions so you know i'm kind of passing the time and these double doors burst open and this guy walks in obviously nick but he doesn't introduce himself he's you know could be anywhere from forty to eighty years of age he has this greased back hair and he's has a stogy between the two teeth left in his mouth and a chew of tobacco possibly also and this wife beater t shirt and yankee shorts and white athletic socks pulled up to his knees and he's shoe polish uh like black sneakers that are obviously shoe polished and he just looks at me and says are your parents gonna mind you taking the train home late at night so i say n you know i take the train to school every day i think it i think it ll be fine and he just kind of looks at me and finally i say no i don't think my parents will mind me taking the train home late at night and he says well come back opening day so that was october you know i go home i think i have the job i'm not not really sure and you know six months later opening day nineteen ninety three i show up at nine a m i put on my jacket and tie i walk back to the stadium i go back downstairs you know through these tunnels and come to this you know big steel door that says yankee clubhouse on and i walk inside and it's complete pandemonium and you know there's uh these ball players that i'd only seen before on tv are across rows and rows of stadium seats and like they're there in the flesh in front of me and don mattingly is over you know on the right and i had a poster of don mattingly above my bed you know for my whole life and he's standing right over there and jimmy key the ace of the pitching staff is over there and and all these guys and you know opening day yankee stadium is not just a sports event it's a news event beginning of spring and in new york and mayor dinkins is there with his entourage and like it's mayor dinkins and don mattingly you know it's so uh i'm walking around and kind of lost and i figure you know i better go find find nick so i walk up to nick and i say nick what do you you know what do you i'm matt we met a couple of months ago what do what do you want me to do it's my first first day of work so he says stay the f out of my way so i kind of like shrink back and throw my backpack over on the side and just kind of wandering around in a daze and i feel a tap on my shoulder i turn around and it's don mattingly and he sticks his hand out and he says how's it going i'm don mattingly are you gonna be working with us this year which you know even at that moment i'd never really thought about the experience in those terms and he could have said so many other things that wouldn't have been as cool as that like he could have said you know are you the who are you or are you the new bat boy are you gonna be working for us this year but he said you know i'm don mattingly are you gonna be working with us this year so i said i know who you are mister mattingly i'm matt i'm the new bat boy and he's like great to meet you matt i have a very big very big job to ask of you i've just unpacked all my bats fro from spring training and i don't know if it was the altitude of the flight up from florida or the humidity down there or what but the game starts in about two hours and i need you to find me a bat stretcher so i say ok so i go i go and find nick and i go you know nick is is busy probably half a dozen ball players are like bothering him for double a batteries or you know my hat size my hat's too small or this or that and i go up and i'm like nick i need a bat stretcher for don mattingly and he lets loose with a stream of expletives that fell on i swear completely virgin ears like i never never heard that type of language in the movies before or anywhere let alone directed at me so i kind of like rock back on my heels and go and find somebody i can trust like n nick's assistant rob and i ask him you know i need a bat stretcher for don mattingly and nick told me to go f myself and i don't i don't know what to do so he was like chill out you know i saw danny tartabull using one in his locker so danny tartabull's the you know power hitting right fielder i go to his locker and i'm he's getting dressed in his uniform and i stand off on the side and he says you know how's it going and i'm like fine i'm matt i'm the new bat boy and i need a bat stretcher for don mattingly and i heard you were just using one so he's like well i was using one but i left it in the manager's office you should probably go check in there so i say thanks and he says see you around and i go into the manager's office and walk in and buck showalter the manager is having a press conference with probably like eight or ten reporters and i stand off on the side and i'm kind of you know the conversation comes to a standstill basically because there's a sixteen year old kid there in his easter blazer and jacket in standing in the manager's office of the yankee stadium two hours before first pitch on opening day looking very lost and very anxious and showalter turns to me and he's like can i help you and i say i i'm matt i'm the new bat boy s really sorry to interrupt but i need a bat stretcher for don mattingly and danny tartabull says that he left it in here so showalter looks down like beneath his desk and {cg} you know he's like well you know i do you need a right handed one or a left handed one so this is the first moment all day that i actually you know this is the first question that i had that i could answer with complete confidence cause you couldn't have grown up in new york at that time you know without knowing that mattingly was the best left handed hitter in baseball so i say i need a left handed bat stretcher so he's like well i think we maybe have a right handed one around here but probably not a left handed one and like you should try down at the red sox clubhouse and see if they have one so i say o ok thanks i'll you know i'm sorry to interrupt i go off at at this point i'm like sprinting down the hallways like the tunnels beneath the stands the first base stands of the stadium and i run into the red sox clubhouse and find their equipment manager and give him like the whole story i'm matt i'm the new bat boy for the yankees and danny tartabull left his right handed bat stretcher in uh in buck showalter's office and i need a left handed one and like the game's about to start and he's like calm down like you know we don't have one but we need one like here's twenty bucks go up to the sporting good store on one sixty first street and river avenue and buy two like buy a left handed one for mattingly and a right handed one for us and then bring me back the change so he gives me the twenty i put it in my pocket i run upstairs you know at this point it's like an hour before opening day the fans are coming down like fifty thousand fans are coming down from you know the subway in the opposite direction that i'm walking i'm the only person in the world who knows that you know if i don't come through on this mission mattingly is gonna go up there against roger clemens and the red sox on opening day yankee stadium with a toothpick in his hand basically so i'm like fighting against the crowd and feeling so much weight on my shoulders and i make my way you know and i'm about to cross the threshold of stan's sporting goods when it dawns on me like i've played a lot of baseball in my life and i've you know been a big fan for a while and like i don't even know what a bat stretcher looks like uh and it it this moment that i'm like walking into the store it dawns on me for the first first time like is uh is this a joke like could this possibly could this possibly be a joke and if it you know but i had so much fear because like if it is a joke and i like go back and i tell don mattingly you know i'm too smart to fall for your you know ya your b s bat stretcher story and i'm wrong i'm gonna be back in the bleachers like before my first game you know and and lose my dream job so you know i take three laps around the stadium kind of convincing myself like it's gotta be a joke like it's gotta be it's gotta be a joke and i you know i walk back back in i go down the stairs i walk into the clubhouse mattingly winks at me from across the clubhouse a couple of other ballplayers laugh mattingly goes three for five that day yankees win it was my first day in pinstripes and uh you know i didn't learn until later on that i was the first kid in anyone's memory to have gotten the job without having a connection without you know somebody knowing somebody or my dad knowing somebody or or whatever which was you know a lesson a lesson in itself and you know as intensely naive my pursuit of that job was you know i was probably as naively intense in chasing the bat stretcher but you know the lesson in the story is you know when there is with a great deal of persistence and a little bit of common sense even if the thing you're chasing may not exist you can sometimes will it into being thank you
so it starts in nineteen eighty nine and it's july and i'm on tour with my band and we're touring through europe and this is a very usual thing i had been touring for years and years seven or eight years by that point so um it we had just come from israel and we had landed in the uk in england so i had never been to israel before and the first time you go there all the security is a bit daunting you know they search you and they search you again and they ask you questions and i found it a little scary so um even though i really enjoyed my time there i was looking forward to coming back to england which was very familiar to me so this was we had just landed in england we were staying at the holiday inn airport uh near heathrow very glamorous {ls}  so um i wake up that morning and um that night i'm going to play at the glastonbury festival in glastonbury so we have a a a a journey to go to and it's probably going to be the biggest audience i'm i'm ever going to face where there's supposed to be seventy five thousand or eighty thousand people there and i'm headlining that night it's a friday night so i'm the last act in the show and all of this is okay this is fine um i pack my stuff i go downstairs to the um to the front desk and there's some kind of altercation at the desk and i see my bass player mikey and he's looking really unhappy he's looking really pale and he's like half puerto rican half italian so pale is not his usual color so i am concerned about this and then i also see my uh tour manager also looking really upset and there's all this buzzing going on and i'm like what's going on so uh we all knew that there had been some girl that had a crush on mike you know and this happens from time to time you know girls fall in love with the guys in the band and i just try and stay out of it um you know and they'd send things or whatever and i try and lay down rules you know we don't want random girls on the bus but you can have your girlfriend or you can have your wife random girls off the bus but i kind of knew about this random girl because she um it started off with little gifts that were coming back stage for mike and we all thought that was really cute and then after that uh it graduated to pictures of herself naked and well whatever um so but then we all became worried because she had actually moved to queens from london to be near him when we were not on tour and we all felt that that was going too far um so now it turned out that now we're back in the uk and we are going to play glastonbury and she has called him uh in the middle of the night and made these threats and said to him that she uh she and her friend who's a male guy who was also calling the hotel uh were going to shoot him if he went out on stage that night so i'm like oh god i hate i hate the i hate that kind of day uh so cause i just want to be in england where it's just nice you know and it was comfortable and it was um you know and and glastonbury is a festival of of hippies basically they have a big peace sign on the stage so uh and i'm thinking is this really gonna happen but my manager feels that we should take it seriously so he calls scotland yard so we were all waiting for mr scotland yard to show up the uh detective shows up and he takes the trip with us on the bus mike is freaking out everybody's freaking out so uh and i'm like okay um so he asks us some questions he finds out some things about this girl he finds out some things about the other man who was making the the calls and this kind of thing so the tension is kind of building it's a long trip and we finally get there and we wind our way through this crowd of people and we're trying to find our way back stage to where the bus is supposed to be and it's kind of muddy i think it had rained and then it had stopped raining so now there's all this dust and stuff in the air and there's throngs of people and we're trying to find our way back stage and once we get there i feel that i that i need to go for a walk i need a little privacy and i try and and go for a walk i figure i'll go check out some of the booths that are selling tie dyed things and military surplus uh mr scotland yard wants to walk with me and i'm like no no it's okay you know you stay with mike i'll be fine no ms vega i feel i really should come with you no i don't want you to come with me you can stay with mike i need to go off and he said no so i said okay fine i'll stay here um then we were gonna on stage at about eleven o'clock uh at about nine thirty suddenly four or five policemen show up and they come onto the bus and they want to have a little chat with me and i'm like why you know mike will be fine he's gonna perform on the side of the stage we have two bodyguards for mike he's gonna perform in a bullet proof vest he's got the two body guards are there one looks like mr clean and one looks like gi joe and they're very handsome guys and they are gonna defend mike so i'm like great what's the problem so the policemen sit me down and they said well we we didn't want to tell you this because we were we didn't want to upset you but your life was also threatened they also said ms vega if you go out on stage you will also get it so being that we have tracked down the woman but we haven't tracked down her accomplice we feel that we need to inform you legally that you should not do the show tonight we that you should not perform on stage tonight so i'm like what are you kidding i'm like this is friday night i'm headlining the glastonbury festival there's like a hundred thousand people uh what do you mean i'm not gonna do the show of course i'm going to do the show you know the show must go on what are you talking about i'm no one's gonna like shoot me on the glastonbury stage under the peace sign um so and then i'm thinking well anyway you don't want to know what i was thinking so um and so i said no no i said i really have to do the show i feel that i really must and my my keyboard player who's also my boyfriend is looking at me with tears in his eyes and he's like no no i i don't think you should do it and i'm like i'm sorry we have to do it how can we possibly come back to england if we don't do the show you know any crazy person can call up on the phone and say that you know whatever they're going to say and then and we they everybody would know that we cancelled um so they said okay well you'll have to wear the bulletproof vest as well so i said okay uh the only one they had was his and this policeman was about two hundred and fifty pounds and i'm like half that size so they put it on me and it's enormous and they strap me in and they gaffers tape it closed so i'm like okay and i'm like can i still play the guitar i think so and then i i i have a they put a huge denim jacket on over that so no one sees the bullet proof vest so now i'm all decked out like a turtle like this and my arms are kind of like this and i'm like okay but you know i felt really strongly that we should we should go on we should risk our lives you know this is rock and roll this is what this is what we do so um i remember that moment when as i was walking out on the stage and i see the microphone there and i'm in my denim jacket and my gaffers tape and my bullet proof vest and things start to feel like i'm going underwater and as i'm heading for the microphone the thought suddenly occurs to me that they could shoot me in the head and i'm like oh i wish i hadn't thought that right now but i'm not thinking about that anymore i'm just heading for the microphone and then i pick up the guitar and i start singing and the other thing that happened was that now this this whole situation has escalated to the point where there's twenty policemen in front of the stage there's a hundred thousand people behind them there's people as far as the eye can see from the stage all the way to the horizon this is like several villages or something um not only that but there's helicopters overhead and they've decided to train the lights not on the stage which they usually do but from time to time the swivel the lights onto the audience to search them to see if they see anyone with a weapon so i'm singing every song feels like it's taking twenty minutes long small blue thing just seems to go on forever and i'm looking and every so often they swivel the lights onto the audience and i'm like you know and i continue to play and every so often i turn around to look at mike course he's not there you know mike is over there with mr clean and gi joe and there's the his um amplifier on the floor so it's like where's mike oh there's his amp so blah blah i'm playing it's all going pretty well i'm thinking wow this is great uh that we're alive and um suddenly my keyboard player approaches me and he says sing luka and get off stage and i'm like why and he goes i can't tell you right now but we have to get off stage by twelve thirty and i'm like okay uh and then i start thinking well why do they want to get me off stage did they find some did they find the weapon did they find the girl did they find her accomplice maybe i should just get off stage and not sing luka luka was my big hit at that point and it was uh and i decided no we're gonna stay we're gonna sing luka we're gonna entertain everybody they've come to be entertained we have to do this so i sing luka everybody's cheering and i come off stage and it all feels like it's going in slow motion and i said what happened did they find the girl no did they find her accomplice no did they find somebody with a weapon no well why did we have to get off stage at twelve thirty and then the promoter of the festival comes over to me and says well ms vega we didn't get a chance to explain this to you before but the festival has a curfew because the farmers in the next field have the the cows and the cows get disturbed if you sing past twelve thirty and it makes them less productive and that's my story and that's it  thank you 
under the influence is our topic tonight and uh i i thought of a lot of different things and and the one i kinda wanted to talk about was my secret influence um there are people in our lives that are incredibly important to us and i would even m mention to say some of the most important people everybody aside from my mother in my life doesn't know anything about this person who i think about every day and his name was michael marquis so if this were a violin piece it would be called ode to michael marquis um i met him when i was seven years old and i was growing up uh my mother had left my father when i was about two or three and this was the first man that my mother had brought home like for me to meet and uh he was a vietnam vet he was a professional athlete ah he had played college football college baseball he was uh a ski instructor and a golf instructor uh he had like a big beard and he drank scotch and he had a german shepherd and he had a lab and he had this unbelievable m g and not like those little like wussy m g s that you see like it was like a nineteen thirty three m g it was like a motorcycle i mean this thing was so cool and the doors like went super low you know i mean it was just so cool and he was so cool and he was the first person to really tap into um he may have tapped into it he may have created it i'm not sure but a momma's boy complex um which was that i had uh i hadn't been my my father lived in texas and i hadn't been to texas since i was about three but i was obsessed i had a dallas cowboys belt buckle i would wear like you know um uh flower t shirts you know like grant parson's or something like that i mean it's just about nineteen seventy seven i was very into that i only listened to willy nelson's the red headed stranger um my room was covered with cowboys and broncos and indians and like anything texas was up my alley and he met me and he's like why what's all the texas stuff you know i was like well you know my dad lives in texas  well he ain't here is he i'm like n nah he's like well i think i'd get over the texas thing if i were you i'd be like you know that really hurt my feelings and and he he proceeded to like latch into this thing like so what you a momma's boy cowboys lost today did your dad call no right he's he's very tough guy very tough guy um and and through uh a little bit of what what my mother felt was kind of abusive behavior um uh uh i i grew to love him right i mean i hated him but i loved him i i i i thought about him all the time and what he would think about something and and like uh for example he decided that uh since i was so into football uh but you don't know how to play football you know what name know any did your dad teach you to play football no i don't think he did did he alright come on let's play football no it's uh i'm not looking for the pity thing it's pretty funny i mean he was a funny guy he he was trying to help me in his own weird way so he takes me outside he takes me outside and he uh he says uh alright i'm gonna teach you how to play football alright but football is a man's game it's not a momma's boy's game {cg} alright you put you you make a diamond with your hands your thumb to your forefingers and if you can touch it you can catch it so i'm like alright bam you know and i'm he's like you still with me you still wanna play football huh i'm like yeah i wanna play football he's like alright if you can touch it you can catch it bam you know and it this this went on i mean and and too was freezing outside and um and my nose is bleeding and um i'm crying and i want to go inside and he's like you know you gotta catch this football alright and so finally i catch it like three times he's like alright see you're not such a little momma's boy after all and i feel kinda good about myself i mean you know i mean go figure you know so my mom really liked him and um we moved to vermont and he took us and he moved us into this one bedroom one no it was just a one room cabin in vermont where uh s he had this gig uh as a ski instructor and um and it was really picturesque and he really had it in his heart like uh to teach me how to be a man you know and we would he taught me how to chop wood and he bought me um a jeans jacket and he would have my mom do like patches on the back you know and it was really very cool and i started to feel very cool he he took me to see um the man who would be king um and uh you know i cr i cried at the end which is ah this is a digression i'm going to regret doing this but but it's my favorite line and since i have an audience i have to tell you it's it's like sean connery is standing on the burning bridge and and michael cain is shot he's the bridge is burning he's gonna die and michael cain scrouts out you know peachy will you ever forgive me for being so bleedin stupid and so bloody arrogant and sean connery says you know that i can and that i do so like michael and i sat there and i just cried and he was just like pull yourself together man you know we got in the car he got his little m g and it's like freezing and i'm crying and he's like come on it was a good movie it was sad but it was you know you gotta you know i loved it too i loved it too but like from then on in my mind like michael and i were you know michael cain and sean connery and on adventures and things and we we had them you know i mean i i had to walk i mean it's really kinda picturesque i had to walk like two miles to school and i was only in second grade and it was very fun he insisted that i do it you know by myself and my my mother had s a lotta problems with like the the the you like my when my mother would go she had to go outa town a couple times and he would take me on dates with other women and like if you tell your mother i'm gonna kick your ass and uh but i thought it was great i mean again like you keep being judgmental and i i was like i was like this guy is so cool and um i remember i like rolled uh joints for him for this other girl i don't know i i i have this vague memory of it but um uh and finally like my most pivotal memory of him aside from the closing of my story uh is uh is we had you know this little one room cabin i mean it was really really uh idyllic snow in vermont and all this other stuff and and and michael we're out on this little deck outside of it and michael's like see that look at that buck look at that buck ok get the shotgun ethan  get the shotgun you know and i'm i'm like i'm like  what for he's like i'm gonna kill it and i'm like i'm like i'm like mom michael's gonna kill a buck michael's gonna kill a buck michael goes hell i was gonna let you shoot it you blew it you know and i didn't know how i felt cause i didn't wanna shoot it but now i felt like i should have wanted to shoot it and like i don't know i felt very strange doesn't exactly make sense but you can understand the subconscious very influenced um and so finally one day i come walking home from school this little cabin and all my mother's underwear and lingerie kinda like things are nailed to the outside of the house right this is a true story alright and i'm like wow that's weird you know  and  and and uh and inside there's like ra ra ra ra ra ra ra you know ba ba and um uh you know we basically get in the car and we're gone and uh we move to atlanta georgia and um you know i don't know any more about what happened there than you do i mean lingerie fighting i don't i can guess you know but i've never asked my mom my mom has a lot of issues but that's not this is michael's ode um and so anyway we move to atlanta georgia and what happens is my father uh gets remarried and for some reason to my now eight year old mind this is very disturbing um i'm not invited to the wedding and i'm very upset about this and and it it it's kind of throwing my whole texas fantasy scheme a a a apart and i get uh but i'm ih i'm in this like weird school in atlanta georgia and i actually get accepted to this a this um little gifted and talented program like for an eight year old right and i i go to and i get kicked out on the second day cause i telled some told some kid that his painting sucked right or the teacher uh uh i didn't get kicked out right away uh uh i had to write a one page essay about why um i would you know about w i was supposed to write about why saying somebody's painting sucked was a bad thing and i wrote in my essay that i didn't know that it was something bad because my mother goes out with lots of guys and the last one that she dated told me i sucked all the time and i didn't think it was that big a deal now that that that sounds like the truth is i knew exactly what i was doing like and it wasn't like it i was trying to make my mom look bad in front of the teachers to like deflect um y you know me being in trouble i my mom was so angry at me she hon like like she got this call from the teacher and she hangs up yeah yeah yeah you little shit you you know uh i don't date lots of guys and michael didn't say you sucked yes he did alright he did but you know like bla bla and um anyway the point is and then i got in a fight and i got kicked out of this gifted and talented thing and it was like a big deal and my father's getting remarried and they sent me to a child psychologist and and my mom comes up with this idea that she's gonna invite michael to come to my birthday like that i i could really use this right but i i don't know about this but so my birthday arrives and we're living in atlanta georgia now and who comes down the street in a little m g with the golden retriever right on the side thing and his hair and his beard and he's got the th you know thing and a bunch of presents in the back comes pulling up and it it was really one of the greatest moments of my li i mean i was so happy to see him and i had all these boys come over um for my birthday party and michael took turns taking us around the block and he would like peel out fishtail around the thing and and my mother would be screaming michael and all the boys would be like your dad is so cool and i'd be like i know i know he's so cool and i i was just it was really one of those glorious days michael took us all to chuck e cheese's and we went to see george burns in oh god and like and everybody was just so into michael and i by you know association was a very studly guy and um and so then it's the night's over and uh michael's gonna leave you know michael says goodbye and i say alright see you later and he starts to go and i go to my room and i start sobbing right and um and and so my mother comes in and is like what are what are you what are you crying about 's like nothing nothing you know i just i wish michael was gonna stay longer you know and and she's like uh alright and she goes outside and uh ok ah but yeah go go go um and uh it's very good very good timing very good timing um like pat riley say pat riley would say it's all good um mm mm so much for him uh but uh so michael comes into my room and i i'm devastated uh because as much as i would like and everything for him to talk to me and everything i am so upset you know and i i really don't want him to see me like this you know and and he tells me uh that you know he's you know he's gonna stay in touch with me and that don't worry

 alright thank you very much alright this is my story i was dating this girl like uh like two years ago been dating her for like eight months and she wanted to meet my parents she was really giving me shit like how come i haven met your parents aiaiai and uh you know i always just i never liked you know i never brought anybody home to meet my parents i was like thirty years old never met brought anybody home i never i didn't ever like meeting people in general like i didn't wanna meet her parents i always hated when you had to meet like you know go out with somebody you like meet their friends n shit all sitting at the table trying to be interesting i usually end up just sitting there staring at like mashed potatoes or some shit so she's like you know how come what's wrong with you you know how come you don't wa me me you know bring you home to meet your parents and i started thinking about it like you know not only had i never brought anybody home you know a girl home you know i was thirty years old i had never brought anybody home even like back in like first grade like second grade i mean i had friends and shit i just never brought them home so i started thinking like you know how the hell did that start you know it's you know so we're basically driving up from new york to go to my house to finally uh meet my parents and uh i remember like i think it was like when i was in first grade we used to have a bus stop and it was like right out in front of my house and my parents used to always be arguing and my dad was like a maniac you know always screaming goddamn fucking bitch you know just total psycho my dad was a complete psychopath you know like his nickname in in my house was called the thing cause that's what he was he was like he was this fucking thing that like if he wasn't around we say dude is the thing home you know if he wasn't home we could chill he was just like never in a good mood so one day i'm down at the bus stop there's like you know ten other kids down there and shit we were all in like first grade second grade third grade waiting for the bus and it's like towards the summer time so my parents got like the windows open and shit so i can start to hear like an argument starting like oh what the fuck do you mean you didn't ahwahah and i'm sitting there i'm sitting there going please please let the bus come please for christ's sake all a sudden you goddamn fucking bitch ahahah screaming and shit and i remember just looking at all the other kids' looks on their faces like i guess you know this is like way before cable so most kids never even heard curses they couldn't believe it and i was just that's when it really hit me that man my family is really screwed up and i started going to other kids' houses and their parents seemed to get along and they were like cool and uh so the whole time i'm driving back with my girlfriend coming up all this stuff is like coming back and i'm thinking and all like i'm a six year old kid again like getting all nervous like how my dad's gonna like act because it's like embarrassing you know i mean {cg} i don't know like like he was one of these dudes where like uh i don't know he was always in a bad mood like if he tried to like teach you something he'd say it once and then when you didn't get it he'd just say it louder and louder and i remember was six and i was going this guy is retarded like i remember we got a dog and he tried to teach this dog how to sit alright it's a dog it doesn't speak english and he's sitting there going like sit this little puppy sit sit down you're gonna get over there and you're gonna sit down dog's sitting there like walking around like peeing like wha what the fuck is wrong with this guy that was like his thing man everything like at my house my parents they were like ridiculously strict we had all these stupid rules like i remember they had like like this one rule whatever you didn't eat for dinner they would  just like wrap it in cellophane and you had to like eat it the next morning for breakfast and its like everybody sitting eating like pancakes and waffles you're like eating like cube steaks and shit you be dad would be going come on eat it i don't want to eat it eat it so i'm like driving back and that's all i'm thinking like this guy's just gonna completely embarrass me and uh i don't know like it's just i just felt weird like my family was like the you know how most families are like loving and like build somebody up like our family was just like ripping somebody down like uh i think the worst think he ever did to me this is the one that really kinda made me like the anxious like worrisome person that i am waha uh was right around christmas and i was already thinking this cause i was driving this girl up for christmas he uh he was giving me shit one day he always hated when i was joking around i think making my mother laugh somehow was i don't know would bug him or whatever so he kept giving me shit come on man you keep joking around you know giggling all the time you're acting like a little girl and i'm thinking like cause he's always fucking with me like oh god he has a new angle you know you ask him for a football for christmas you act like a little girl what the fuck's wrong with you and i'm just sitting there going ah jeez so like two weeks later it's christmastime i got like four brothers right and we always sneak down to go look at the presents so we go downstairs right there's all these gifts down there all wrapped and we're all looking to see who got what you know and there's all these little tags to ed from santa you know be like to bob from mom and dad or whatever and i'm sitting there pause just wait a sec pause so i look and in like the middle of the tree i see there's a doll and i'm thinking i've got four brothers why the fuck is there a doll sitting here i don't know i'm just looking at this thing you ever seen like those spike lee movies where like the background moves and the character doesn't it's like one of those deals and i look up at this doll right and it says to bill from santa and i'm like what the fuck guy got me a goddamn doll he came downstairs and he's laughing and shit and he's making me take a picture i'm like six years old and crying and stuff and uh and and i'm thinking of this shit as i'm pulling into the driveway i'm like freaking out cause i'm finally gonna bring somebody home to meet this fucking maniac and uh and i'm telling her i don't know how this guy's gonna be or whatever so we walk into the house and it's like uh candles and shit christmas tree it's all real nice dim lights and stuff she comes in she meets my dad and the dude is like totally normal after me building this guy up the whole ride back he's like fucking like you know that dude from leave it to beaver he's like the nicest guy ever he's all cordial and i remember i'm just getting like pissed at the guy like why isn't he being a dick and she's sitting there taking me aside going he's the greatest guy i can't believe you're saying all that stuff he's such you know he's smart intelligent he's so interested in what i have to say i remember was like i was so pissed at the guy i mean i really hated him when i was growing up to the point i remember one time he went out in the driveway and he was running out to his car and he slipped and fell and broke his shoulder and at that point me and my brothers so fucking hated this guy when he came into the house my mother's like taking care of him we snuck out the back door to look at his footprints in the snow to see where he slipped and fell and i'm telling you we were laughing our asses off at this guy like right there right there that's wha fuck why couldn't i have seen that so uh so he ended up being like the sweetest guy ever and there was nothing anxious about it i was like worried about for like i don't know from the beginning of the time dating girls like from fifteen and i just ended up feeling really stupid and uh i was kinda pissed i was looking at the guy going like why the fuck couldn't you have been like this you know twenty years ago when i needed him to be like that rather than you know being the way he was and uh that's my story thanks
i grew up in a really small town in alabama and my sister was and is to this day a remarkably beautiful woman and i was always really good in school so it fell into this pattern with my family where people would say things like she's the beauty you're the brain and among my almost anorexically petite friends growing up at five foot five a hundred and forty pounds it was universally acknowledged that i was the fat one the whole thing really started in first grade i have to say there was a weigh in in school my best friend nan coley who was going to go on to become the head cheerleader of our high school hopped on the scale and weighed forty five pounds but when i jumped on the needle cropped uh creeped up to fifty and i looked over and i could see nan looking at me in horror not just for me but for herself and she suggested right then and there that i go on a diet and so i did for the next twenty years i would never wear a bathing suit without putting a t shirt over it first i would never change at a sleep over party without getting in a sleeping bag i would never let a lover see me naked with the lights on and not once did i ever stand in front of my closet to pick out an outfit with any other intention other than to look as thin as possible now along the way well meaning people tried to help but just made things worse such as my stepmother the baywatch extra who decided when i was eleven you know at  at eleven years old she decided to give me a makeover but the result was something like if you put blue ah sh eyeshadow and frosty pink lipstick on a cabbage patch kid it wasn't good but somehow i managed to get through high school and college and at age twenty six i packed up my baggage and moved to southern california where surprisingly i actually got better there was something about like all the you just extreme views that people had about their body all the fake everything um and the bleach blonde hair that made me kind of give up i think i kinda uh i think i kind of threw in the towel and so i joined the gym down the street because it was cheap and i discovered that lifting weights could be actually fun because you would get strong and then with my newfound muscle tone i put on shorts for the first time ever and went for a hike which led to a run and then when food was no longer the enemy i started cooking healthy food and after six months i actually lost twenty pounds and one day i was getting dressed to go out and i actually glanced in the mirror which of course i usually avoided and um i realize i almost didn't recognize myself and i i i examine myself from head to toe standing there in my bra and panties and discover that actually couldn't lose any more weight and i actually look pretty darn good now around the same time my boyfriend was back in boston and he had decided to produce an independent film and he was begging me to come back east to produce the film for him but in order to do that i calculated that i was gonna have to raise two thousand dollars over the next four months somehow extra which my eleven dollar an hour temp job really wasn't gonna produce so i went out and got a copy of the l a times and as i was perusing the ads for like you know chuck-e-cheese night manager and you know evening legal secretary work i saw an ad that said dancers wanted earn up to five hundred dollars a night now you have to understand that i cannot dance i'm somewhat famous ang among my friends for having tripped over my own feet when i was in college in boston and actually knocked myself unconscious on the sidewalk it's true so i ignored it and went to the other ads but i kept coming back to it like five hundred dollars a night so i threw down the newspaper and i ran to my room and like in in examined my butt carefully in the mirror like could it be that my butt was good enough and i picked up the phone and made an appointment with a woman named samantha now my best friend steve was very against this he's like catherine your newfound self esteem has been too long coming and too hard won for you to risk it all because some bitch down at the strip club doesn't think you're good enough and i knew he was right but i somehow couldn't stop i just had to see so the next day i put on my sluttiest outfit and made my hair huge and put on like all the make up i owned and i went down and as i walked into the club the most beautiful woman i've ever seen to this day was pulling herself upside down naked up a pole with grace and i was like what am i doing but just then i heard someone say you must be renee now renee was a totally insane alcoholic legal secretary that i worked with and i was think i was hoping to channel her so i picked that as my fake name and i said yes i'm renee and i thought that there was gonna be all these questions and i had to memorize this detailed like personal history that was all a lie but she just took one look at me and said when can you start so while i wanted to what in my head i was thinking like no way um i was like uh how about monday and she said ok over the weekend i went out and bought a brand new pair of silver panties and a silver push up bra and these really amazing silver high heels now my steve was still trying to talk me out of it he was like catherine the smarter the stripper the more they hate stripping what are you gonna do when some asshole comes up to you and says hey you're pretty hot do you want to give me a blow job afterwards in the parking lot you're gonna wanna tell him to fuck off but what you're gonna have to do is go well i'll get fired if i do that but i'll be fantasizing about it the entire time you're on sta i mean i'm on stage and he said do you think you can do that and i was thinking you know for five hundred dollars a night maybe i can so um uh so uh sah so uh oh insanely that monday morning i actually went to work at my temp job and so at five o'clock i got off and showed up at the club wearing my temping outfit which was these very baggy awful black pants a little sailor top my hair you know very straight and my glasses and as i walked in i was told to go over and tell the d. j. what my song would be and i walked over i was like hi i'm the new girl i'll be dancing to alanis morisette and he was just like alright and he says the dressing room's over there and i looked at the dressing room and suddenly i realized that behind that dressing room were probably ten drop dead gorgeous women and i was like oh my god and so i looked at the door and i looked at the door of the club and just then i heard hi you must be the new girl i'm chloe and i turn and to my right was this little patricia arquette sort of knock off girl and she was wearing stars on one boob and spangle on the other and one of these seventies style bikinis with a little silver skirt and she was adorable um she was like hi i'll show you the way so chloe grabs me by the hand drags me off and leads me into the dressing room and i start getting dressed with the other girls and actually the other girls were pretty nice um and so they explained to me the rules of the club which i hadn't known before um in the first place the first s song you did you know in your bra and panties and little whatever you wore after but the sec and they were like the the only the second song is topless and i was like the second song is topless i think i think the whole time i'd been picturing that i'd just go out onstage and flit around a little at the very end i'd drop my bra and run but no you had to be topless for an entire song and i'm like oh no but i was like ok and like they were all looking at me like i can't back out so like i'm taking off my clothes and everybody's just naked and so just then um the dj who's this fo you know three hundred pound man named rudy comes into the room and he says um and he's like hey girls and al the girls are kinda like aaaah rudy get out aaaah and like i'm naked and like i but i didn't even care and and i realized at the time i  wa that maybe i'd gone somewhere that i'd never been before mentally and maybe i was gonna get through this night um so rudy leaves and um i'm starting to get dressed and the girls go no you can't wear those silver panties you have to wear a g string and i was like oh no i don't have a g string well bye bye bye um but janee was this leggy blonde from texas whose claim to fame was that she stripped into her sixth month of pregnancy janee says hi um i just washed mine here you can borrow this and she throws it at me i'm like well alright so i'm putting on a strange girl's g string and i put it on and so the girls um help me do my hair and like make it huge and they put on my make up and like fake eyelashes and all this stuff and um i was ready to go and as i walked out i glanced in the mirror and i have to say that i looked unbelievable so thank you so um so i go out and i go back out to rudy and i'm like hi i'm ready for my song and he looks at me and he's like holy shit box all that was under there and i was like thank you um so then um chloe starts giving me a tour of the club and as we she's doing this this guy comes up to us on crutches he'd b claimed he'd been shot in a gang fight and um he comes up to me and he goes you're pretty hot ya know i'll put you in a music video if you'll give me a blowjob after the show and i'm like steve you know and um chloe says you know grabs m you know jumps back and screams fuck you she's a stripper not a goddamn whore and i was just like nice nice so then um i so then we walk back out and uh and it's horribly the beautiful woman from like the audition day um was out on stage again and she was an incredible dancer and she's running around and i'm just like uh oh my god but so i could tell chloe i'm like you know i'm really a little nervous and she goes no no no you'll have no problem she's like it's not the best dancers that make all the money it's the girls who can really connect with the men who can look from guy to guy to guy and make the guy think that they're only looking at them um and it's really not being about a dancer they just want to see you nude up there um but the biggest problem you're gonna have is that you're gonna get bored now being bored was not something that occurred to me as it was going to be a problem she's like no you know there i have a special trick it's called the drop and role so what you do you know is you go out there and you sort of like slowly slowly slowly slowly lower and like slowly slowly slowly roll around she's like they'll they'll picture you rolling around in their beds and then slowly slowly slowly slowly stand back up and if you do it slow enough it could take up like two minutes and i was like great um so i go out and um so then chloe has to do her song and i go and i sit down near the door and um i get a coke to drink because i didn't wanna drink alcohol because i had to drive home like i'm such a nerd and so i sit there and um all of a sudden like it was a really cold night and um the wind blew in and i got really cold and of course i hadn't eaten for like three days cause i was so nervous you know kind of like today and um so i was like i started to freak out and i looked up and i was just like what what am i doing and so i go over to chloe who's come off stage now and she's sitting next to um mister shot in the leg guy like they've made up now they're friends again and so i go over and i'm like hi you know i was like you have been so great and thank you so much but i just realized that i can't dance so i'm gonna go home and practice and i'm gonna come back and chloe looked at me uh right in the eyes and she said if you walk out of that door right now you will never come back and you will regret it for the rest of your life and i knew that she was right and just then mister shot in the leg guy reaches out like under the little dress i'm wearing and grabs my bare ass and you know sort squeezes it and he slaps me in the ass and he says you know this is the worst you feel this this is the worst thing that's gonna happen to you all night and he smacks me he goes now get up on that stage and i was like alright and so so i went out onstage and you know so i went out and i walked over and there was a pole and so i sort of swung around the pole and like chloe's running around getting everyone to yell and scream a very supportive friend and um so like i'm running around and um but and then all of a sudden insanely i run out of things to do and i'm like oh the drop and roll so i'm like lower lower lower lower lower roll roll roll and as i'm rolling around i feel something hit my cheek and i'm like oh my god i'm so bad they're throwing napkins at me and but i turn my head to the right onstage and i open my eyes and i saw that it was a dollar bill and i was like oh and so then i'm like leans off like this and i see standing above me is mister shot in the you know gang fight man and he's standing over me with a roll of ones pulling them off and dropping them down on top of me and all i could think was i swear to god was what would my ophthavolg ba ophthalmologist father back in alabama think if he could see me right now so um but then like everyone was throwing money and it was amazing and so i got up and then it came to finally be the dreaded topless song so i went to the special topless part of the stage and the song started and um i unhooked my bra very slowly and slowly the strap and slowly the strap and then i let the bra drop to the floor and i stood there in front of a hundred and fifty people wearing only a g string the whole crowd went nuts and i have to say it was one of the most amazing moments of my entire life um no one in that club gave a shit what i'd made on my s.a.t. no one cared that i was a straight a student no one cared that i was in the gifted class when i was eight they just wanted to see me nude it was so cool i never went back to the club after that night in the first place security was pretty lax um chloe kept making like s like little passing remarks ok chloe chloe kept making remarks about how only a few of our friends have been killed by customers which i found disconcerting um but the worst part was ah the next day at work walking across the sony lot i suddenly was examining every strange man that passed me i was noticing them and checking them out and um i've always been one of the and they and they seemed kind of yucky to me um i was sort of it's like every man was suddenly a customer i've always been one of those women that really loves men and i thought if this is what i'm like after three hours what am i gonna be like after three months or three years um but several good things came out of it in the first place one of the customers taught me this really cool trick which is if a guy's pawing you you hold his hand cause he thinks you're holding his hand but what you're doing is you're holding his hand off of you uh this came in super handy the next summer in my ba uh career as a film producer um but the best thing of all is that to this day any time i'm having a fat day or i've just broken up with someone or i'm just feeling a little down about myself all i have to do is open the door and peek into the back of the closet where i still keep those silver high heels and i know in my heart that everything is gonna be ok thank you
so a lot of people are raised with a religion and i'm one of those people that was raised with two there was our official religion my family is and i was at the time conservative evangelical christians but then there was our unofficial faith and hope we had in mary kay cosmetics um many of the women in my family had been mary kay beauty consultants since i was a child and i loved jesus as long as i could remember but that mary kay thing was i was hoping to dodge that bullet um i was this brainy grunge girl from boulder county i wore hemp jewelry and clothes from the salvation army i had moral obliga um objections to wearing make up and when i got a scholarship to go out of state for college i thought i'd made my big escape but my last visit home i listened to one recruiting tape too many and the logic and reason finally got to me and i signed the dotted line and i started my business as a mary kay beauty consultant now on paper the business plan looks foolproof all you're supposed to need is to have one friend to host a party for you where you sell skin care and make up to her friends then you're supposed to book two more every time so your date book is never empty but i could never book two more i used the script i thought i was fun to be with i don't know what the problem was but luckily for me there was like a hundred other ways they trained us to get bookings and one of these ways was to strike up seemingly natural conversations with perfect strangers and we had {cg} we had a name for this we called this warm chatter and i thought dammit i am gonna rock this i am gonna be the queen of warm chatter so what i'm about to tell you i did this um for very long time about two three days a week for two or three hours a day i would get dressed up in my business suit and i'd put on all my make up and i'd pack my bag full of samples and i would drive to target and in target i would get my red shopping cart and i'd pretend i was shopping for items but really i was just hunting for women i was um i was looking for women who looked cute or friendly or approachable when i found somebody like this then i would just discreetly follow her through the store until we could be together in an aisle alone and then i would appear  to just be  walking by normally and i would slow down and in the most casual way possible i would say these words that i'd rehearsed a hundred million times i would say excuse me can i ask you a quick question i'm jen with mary kay and we just came out with a new line of lip glosses and i need some women's opinions of it you know i have some samples here in my bag is there any reason why you wouldn't want to take one home and try it and this part was really important we were trained to smile and nod while we asked the question it has to do with nonverbal communication and mirroring it's very advanced and um and if she said yes i'd give her the sample i'd get her phone number when i called her back later to thank her i would offer her a complimentary appointment with me and i wouldn't mention that all my appointments were complimentary cause it just didn't seem important so at the same time i was doing this for my career my husband and i were also leading helping to lead programs for our local church and this is the kind of church that was trying to be really hip and modern it met in a strip mall and we had a rock band a rock band leading worship up front the pastor was this forty something british guy and he really wanted to attract twenty somethings so we were a hot commodity we were right in the demographic and we started to get promoted up into higher and higher echelons of leadership so we were invited to the leadership team meeting and then the core leadership team meeting and i still remember my first night at one of these meetings and i don't know exactly what i was expecting but i think i'd always imagined them to be kind of soulful events and i was really dismayed to show up and discover it was this really tedious conversation about branding and marketing and what the church's next advertising campaign was going to be so it didn't take too long before these two worlds the church and mary kay started to look more and more similar um they both had the lure in mary kay it was giving out free samples but at the church we were having free events to try and get people in the doors in both worlds we were couching everything we did inside a conversation about service so mary kay's company tagline at the time was changing women's lives which if you think about it isn't that different from saving people's souls and um and we really we really believed it we really thought we were doing this even though nobody's motives are that pure and in both worlds i was being trained all the time to listen to people everywhere i went for whatever was missing or not working about their life and offer what we had as the solution so if you needed time or money or flexibility mary kay might be perfect for you but if you're struggling with your marriage or you've had a recent loss maybe you're questioning the meaning of life call me crazy but have you considered maybe jesus is the answer and soon i just started to feel like a twenty four hour saleswoman and it started to get confusing like which hat i was wearing at which time until one day i was in target with my little red cart and i saw this lovely looking redhead who smiled so big when i smiled at her and i started into my script excuse me can i ask you a quick question except this time it started to sound kind of flat like those pull string dolls that sound kind of wonky at the end and um suddenly i was just thinking does she need mary kay or does she need jesus does she need mary kay or does she need jesus and i don't know which one i offered her but she said no because i was acting crazy um and she turned and walked away and i realized the problem with whenever you have something whether it's a religion or business or anything else that you think is the right answer for everybody through that lens you can't help but look at everyone in the world as if they're broken and need to be fixed and i didn't want to do that anymore so i put my cart away at the front of the store and i drove home the next night was my weekly success meeting and the director was up front telling us giving us all the information about the new lipstick formula and the changes that were being made and i start to look around the room at these women and they were either my friends who i'd like recruited into it or my relatives who had recruited me into it and i was thinking about how devastating it would be when i quit because i wasn't just rejecting everything they stood for but i was letting down my friends i'd gotten them into it i was bailing on them and then my relatives the people who'd recruited me their income depended on me their income their status all of our fortunes were tied in together and i thought but is this really changing women's lives the way i hoped it would and the director started passing around mirrors and lipstick samples for us to try it ourselves and i thought no i don't think so anymore and a couple days later was the church leadership meeting and the pastor was telling us that the church's new mission statement needed to have five points one for every finger on the hand so people could remember it and i started looking around this room and thinking about what they would think about me when i quit they would think i was backsliding and falling off the wagon but it was even worse than that they would think i was going to hell that my children were going to hell and if i was wrong maybe they would be right and i thought but is this really saving people's souls this all this that we're doing and the pastor interrupted to say that all five points needed to start with the same letter and i thought no i don't think so anymore and so that was when i stopped trying to save the world and i decided to save myself instead from this life i didn't want anymore and it it really cost me i lost my identity i lost belonging i lost the ability to ever be that certain or righteous about anything ever again and if you can imagine what it's like to lose a faith and then imagine what it's like to lose two at once because even though mary kay was a business it wasn't just that it was a way i thought the world worked the way i thought that we could all win and everybody could get what they needed it was really devastating i felt like i might not ever be able to trust myself again the last piece of our exit strategy was our move to new york we were going to get geographic distance start fresh someplace else we landed in brooklyn in a neighborhood called park slope and everywhere we went people were either trying to recruit us into or warn us against joining the park slope food coop and it seems so unobjectionable you know like who can argue against cheap organic environmentally friendly food community run and part of me was really tempted because i thought i can have my identity back everyone will know i'm a good person and i can belong again but there was something about the way that the people we talked to were just so convinced it was the right thing for everybody that felt creepily familiar and i thought i know where that path leads so when one particularly zealous friend cornered me one day and said are you gonna join or not are you in or are you out i just took a deep breath and i looked her in the eyes and i said sorry i don't do religions anymore thank you
um it was five days before my ten year high school reunion when my husband told me he thought he might be gay he wasn't sure he was gay cause he had never been with a man yet but he thought it was something he ought to figure out good idea um now i i think he told me this at that moment not to get out of my high school reunion which would be understandable but in order to um because we had been looking for  houses together and we'd finally found one in pasadena that we both liked and i think somehow the forever of the wedding vow sounded kind of vague and idealistic to him where as thirty year mortgage was surprisingly specific it was a commitment you know the kind of commitment you shouldn't make while your sexuality is pending so now i as he was explaining this to me i was thinking downstairs our neighbors we live in this duplex apartment we were renting the kaufmans were probably just sitting down for dinner as they had done for fifty two years and talking about their brisket and  they were this couple that used to come up and see our new furniture like when we bought a new antique table cause sam liked antique shopping pink flag and um they so they were like parent figures to us and um and you know there were signs like when i first met sam he had this leather jacket with a tiger print lining and i remember thinking it seemed kinda the lining i don't know it stuck with me and then um and you know but then he asked me out and we slept together and he asked me to marry him and i put on the big white dress which he helped me pick out in front seriously in in front of um you know two hundred close witnesses my closest friends and i figured he's not um and also i actually i guess i there was one thing i ignored which i probably should have paid attention to he told me before we were while we were engaged he told me he sometimes noticed men but he said he couldn't imagine sleeping with a man and you know he just noticed them and i guess i knew this was not good because i didn't talk to any girl friends about this and i talk to girl friends about everything so if i didn't it was probably bad but i did at one point i did talk to one girl friend we were in line at disneyland for space mountain and i told her how sam had said he sometimes notice men and do you think that's bad and she said you know she told me this theory of the spectrum of sexuality and everyone lies somewhere along it and some people notice people but they would never act on it and uh well four years later she realized she was a lesbian so s my one person i confessed to um so as i was recalling all these signs i realized sam was still talking and um he was telling me he felt so much better getting this off his chest and he'd been wanting to tell me for a long time and he felt so relieved he he kind of wanted to have sex and i said with who and he said with you and i think he meant is as a complement but i was like i have to go to bed and wake up when the book stores are open so the next day i went directly to the self help section um where all problems could be solved and there was no book for someone who's husband who thought he might be gay there was um there was a book called loving someone gay but it turned out to be for teachers and family members um but nothing and and um and i was i was nervous because this is la and i didn't wanna pioneer a problem i this is a ba very bad sign and as i'm looking for a book any book i remember i saw one called um how to survive alien abduction and it wasn't a humor book it was a serious book with like things like block their mind control and you know get help from on high and so basically according to the laws of supply and demand you're more likely to be abducted by an alien than to have your husband realize he's gay that's what that said to me and so i um i left the self help section despondent and decided that it was time to go to therapy four days now from my high school reunion um so i went for the first time i had never gone to therapy i grew up in oklahoma which was where my reunion was gonna be and um i went i there was this thing called the gold group cause i was in a writer's guild basically when i became a comedy writer i decided my husband no longer wanted to be a straight man that was basically what happened there so i was in the writer's guild and um i went they paid for this gold this is true they pay for this thing called the gold group and it was a group of therapists in the valley and um it was only a ten dollar co pay and and it's possible you shouldn't skimp on therapy but i but i thought i was gonna be in for a while so i um i went to the gold group and i remember when i got in there um you basically get what you co pay for because there i i was in this office waiting for my therapist and i could hear the session next to me it was this paper thin wall and i could hear a man sobbing and i was like they're they're gonna hear me sobbing and then when my therapist came in she turned on this little f oscillating fan which i think is a system the gold group had come up with to deal with the sound proofing problem and um so and my therapist and i didn't have anything to compare against but i just remember noting she was just very badly dressed like pink and red together and stripes and i thought she can't put together an outfit and she has to put together my whole life this is not good so um and she had all these questions i hadn't even thought of like do you think you should you be hiv tested maybe he's lying and he's been cheating on you and she had a lot of anger that we worked on so she felt better um okay so i proceeded my decision was to go to the reunion with sam and pretend everything was fine because it seemed better than um well one problem was sam wasn't ready to come out cause he hadn't started uh see when he told me he thought he might be gay he said maybe i'll only be thirty percent gay i'll find out and then i could still be with you and i was overwhelmed at the moment but i do remember thinking so he'll sleep with ten men and then enjoy three of them i'm confused how we're gonna do the math of this so um so he hadn't started that experiment yet so he wasn't ready to come out cause he didn't know yet so we just went to my reunion like that so we stayed with my parents which is not a fun thing even when your husband doesn't think he might be gay and um and my and i remember at the reunion i won most successful and i just was like yeah and my husband's gay so you know it's oklahoma the the runner up was like the manager of the footlocker so it wasn't a huge honor but um but anyway i remember when i went home i was really nervous about my mom cause my mom it was like being you know that scene in my fair lady when the linguistic experts asked her to dance that's how it was like being alone with my mom with a secret cause my mom like right now she would say your voice sounds a little tight honey you she's like very eagle eye about these emotional things and i kept worrying and trying to avoid her and i completely thought forgot about my dad and um at one point he was sitting there watching espn and he said is everything okay and i said no you know if everything was okay sam would be in here watching espn with you instead of in the kitchen flipping through house beautiful with mom and he and i basically told my dad everything which is not the system in my house you tell my mom and my mom tells my dad but i told my dad and um and then i remembered why i don't ever tell my dad because he was like it was like i was ask he thought it was as if sam was asking permission to have an affair and he and i should just say no so he's in fact his words were i'd like to sleep with debbie reynolds but your mom's not gonna let me which i was like but what if you wanted to sleep with burt reynolds so and um and to his credit he had no experience with this in college he had one you know there was one guy in his fraternity that everyone knew had realized he was gay and left his wife and kids jerry hobbleman and no one had ever heard from him again that was like his whole experience with the gay population so he was no help and um somehow though sam and i survived our uh my highschool reunion but um mr kaufman who lived downstairs did not survive the weekend he had died in his sleep of a heart attack and there was a funeral and um and i remember it was kind of a highlight for me because i had been crying in such inappropriate places all week and finally i was at a funeral and i could just sob even though i think it was odd to people cause they were like is she the tennant because i was kind of losing it like grabbing kleenex from the mother you know um but um but i remember i was there with sam and we were holding hands and we were thinking um i was thinking if at least at a funeral there's a body and a grave and um something tangible to mark the end and with a relationship it's never so clearly marked and um it was a relief to be there with with sam for closure and then being at a jewish funeral there was a need for a minion where they needed ten men to go and i remember thinking don't go with the men to sam i did not want him to go with the men but then finally i said go and i realized i meant it in the largest sense possible and about a week later um my dad called me and he s he said you know it's a really ninety nine percent genetic this whole homosexuality thing and i was completely thrown and thought that maybe he had been on the internet and researching and and it turned out that my dad had called jerry hobbleman and asked him to lunch he had tracked down this man and took him to denny's and um and um i'm sure there were lots of disclaimers cause my dad does not take men to lunch so he probably was afraid it would sound like a date or something and um i'm sure when he showed up in shorts and black dress socks and loafers it was clear he was not of the gay persuasion but he um but he asked jerry all the things he wanted to ask um my i guess and couldn't like could you have avoided this and did you ever regret it and is your wife okay and it maybe was the nicest thing a father ever did taking jerry hobbleman to lunch and um just about a week after that sam was finally moving out and um i remember we were in the top floor of our duplex and downstairs mrs kaufman was gardening like she always did and um sam hadn't talked to her yet because she was like a parent figure and he still wasn't ready to come out and he wasn't dealing with things as he hadn't dealt with many things um and so i said you have to tell her cause the moving van is going to be here any minute and she's gonna wonder cause and he wouldn't so i went downstairs to talk to her and um i remember she was she'd always loved gardening but it was really about k she seemed more desperate than ever to kind of keep things alive nurture the living things and not to let things slip away and she couldn't imagine why i was letting my husband slip away and i couldn't explain to her um and so we just sat together on this bench um shoulder to shoulder two women alone but not really alone as the moving van lumbered over to the sidewalk thank you
 i love numbers i love how straightforward and direct they are i love how one plus one is always equals to two and how two plus two without a doubt equals to four and so when it was time for us to decide what we wanted to do in university i knew for sure that i wanted to walk with numbers so you can imagine my joy when i heard about something called actuarial science for those of you who do not know what that is it's this really amazing course that has you spending your days doing things like calculus and probability and statistics it's what insurance companies nee use to know the mortality rates hence tell you how much premium you need to pay it's what governments use to know what areas to invest i mean who wouldn't want to spend the rest of their lives doing that but just before i went to university i was diagnosed with epilepsy and the doctor told me that i had to make sure i did three things eat well slept well and never missed my medication so i'm doing the doctor's advice i enrolled to do actuarial science at the university of nairobi a few years into it i was lucky enough to get an internship at an insurance company i remember my first day there i had a mismatched suit but it was a suit nevertheless and the director's assistant was assigned to show me around and since we were almost the same age we quickly clicked and made it a routine to come very early in the morning just to share our dreams and ambitions a few weeks into the job the company got a really big business deal which meant all of us had to chip in and we spent one friday afternoon learning how to use this new fancy photocopying machine on saturday morning when reported for duty i got the honorable duty of working with the new photocopying machine i remember walking into the copier room armed with a ream of papers and a stack of files that i needed to photocopy i opened the machine just to make sure it had enough papers as we had been instructed the day before then i woke up in the hospital and the doctor told me that i have something called photosensitive epilepsy this is a type that is triggered by flashing lights and in my case with the being from the photocopying machine and since i had a known history of epilepsy the doctor said that there was no need for me to be admitted and that i should go home and get some rest so i went home got some rest and was looking forward to monday morning to redeem myself at the workplace on monday morning i went back to the office and the director's assistant told me that i had been given two weeks to get more rest i was really excited about this because here i was doing my dream job and i was working for a company that cared about my health and so i went home and i did some research on this photosensitive epilepsy so that i i could make sure it never happens in the workplace again and after the two weeks i went back to work and the director's assistant told me that they'd given me two more weeks this time round i wasn't as excited as i was before for some reason deep within me this two plus two was not adding up to four and so in the evening after work hours i called the director's assistant and i asked her if she had heard anything about my case and after few minutes of silence in what was almost like a whisper she said to me sitawa the director said that we cannot work with someone like you this meant that they couldn't work with someone with a health condition like mine and after a few more moments of silence she said that he was thinking of telling the person who'd introduced me to this insurance company to break the news to me i can't really recall how that phone conversation ended i don't know if she hanged up first or if i hanged up first but i remember bursting out into tears and i cried because of the pain i felt that the director of this insurance company did not have the courage or the integrity to tell me to my face that i didn't have a job anymore but he kept giving me two and two more weeks off but most of all i cried because i didn't ask for this i just started falling down and so after a few days of crying i turned my tears into words and moved those words to a blog and before i knew it people living with epilepsy were coming to my blog for inspiration and information and support and as the numbers grew i started a hotline and they were able to get prompt support from it i still love numbers i love the truth in them i love the fact that numbers tell us things about people and from the numbers i have interacted with i see a future where people like me living with epilepsy increase in the workplace i also see a future where people working with us know that they can work with us and they can touch us and they'll not get this thing that we have and this thing that we have only puts us down for  a little while and after that we are able to rise up to contribute to the wellbeing of this amazing world that we live in
 so i'm standing in the phone box and i put twenty pence in and i phone my boyfriend and he answers so i put a pound coin in and just as we're about to speak i suddenly feel the door behind me open a hand appears out of nowhere and i watch it press down the switchhook of the phone i hear the pound coin drop to the bottom and i watch this hand remove the coin earlier that evening i had actually been staying at my boyfriend's flat he lived on main university campus in birmingham city center he was away on work experience and he'd given me the keys to his flat which was great for me because i lived off main campus a another site in handsworth word a short bus ride away but after spending a few nights there and a really long day in the library i suddenly had this urge that i needed to go home i just needed to be in my own space i needed fresh clothes i wanted to sleep in my own bed and i really missed my flatmates but as soon as i thought it a voice in my head said don't go but i want to go and again the voice said don't go now to tell you the truth i wasn't really sure what to make of this voice it made me quite anxious but i couldn't quite figure out what it meant or what could possibly happen and i had to think about it for a while and eventually i decided no i'm gonna go home but to appease this voice in my head i decided to remove my jewelry my watch leave my cards behind and my cash but just take enough money for my bus fare there and to return the following morning and enough also to phone my boyfriend from the pay phone on campus and so i set off and it was probably about i don't know eight thirty in the evening so i was studying in birmingham and it their subways particularly when i was there had a reputation for being quite seedy and unsafe and i had actually been flashed at a number of times down there but on this particular occasion as i walked through the tunnel i noticed a female police officer ahead of me and i remember thinking this was a good omen i kind of broke my stride so we were almost walking in tandem without making it too obvious and then i exit the subway and i get to my bus stop and usually regardless of what the timetable says i always have to wait half an hour for my bus but on this particular evening it comes within minutes so i when i get on the bus i actually sit near the bus driver because i think this is the most sensible thing to do and then i arrive at my stop and at this point i'd say i'm pretty much on the home stretch all i have to do now is get home and as i'm walking along this street i suddenly notice an empty phone box on the corner and in that moment i decide i'm gonna call my boyfriend from there now i make this decision because the pay phone on campus serves about fifty people and it's always ringing off the hook so if i really wanna speak to my boyfriend tonight this is my best chance i realize at this point i'm slightly deviating from the plan of just going straight home but i can distinctly remember as i felt the door close behind me i'm safe in here it's a box so i put my money in and i call my boyfriend and then suddenly i feel the door behind me open a hand appears out of nowhere and i watch it press down the switchhook of the phone i hear the pound coin drop to the bottom and i watch this hand remove the coin i don't remember dropping the receiver but i do remember seeing it swing from side to side suddenly these arms tighten around me and i can feel something sharp against my neck and i'm scared i'm so scared my mouth is dry and i can hardly breathe and my heart is beating so fast i can feel it pulsing in the back of my throat like at any moment it could just rip through and i'm fighting so hard to stop my knees from buckling and i keep saying to myself over and over again is this happening this isn't happening is this really happening to me i think i'm told not to move or make a sound but i can't be sure he asks me for money but i don't have any no wait i i do i have seventy five pence i think he thinks i'm mocking him so i give him my bag and he turns me around and he pushes me up against the phone and through the sheer panic of it all something happened to me i was suddenly overcome by this strange sense of calm presence and lucidity my senses were heightened and i could feel and sense everything around me it was like i was inhabiting every cell of my body and i think time must have stood still or something because after that everything happened in slow motion the voice in my head asks me so how does this end what happens now and so i start running through all these different scenarios in my mind or maybe i'm stabbed and i die or maybe i'm raped stabbed and then i die or maybe maybe i'm stabbed but i go into intensive care but then i slip into a coma and then i die and the voice says well whatever way you look at this you really have nothing to lose but if you do survive the police will want a description you need to get a description so i slowly raise my hands and i turn around to face him and i tell him to check my pockets for money just in case he doesn't believe me and as he does i look at him and i take the image of him in the color of his hair his eyes his clothing his height and the stanley knife in his hand he looks up and he notices the tracking movements of my eyes and he quickly turns me around and he forces me up against the phone his hands start to move over my breasts and the voice says don't move don't even flinch let him touch you let him think he has you and so i do let him touch me and for a brief moment i can almost sense a slight release of tension in his arm and all the while i kept thinking to myself how did i get into the phone box which way did the door open what side of the door was the handle on which hand did i use meanwhile his hands are traveling downwards towards my groin and in that moment i decide i'd rather die i grab his arms and i use my weight to push him backwards into the door and using my elbows i swing to the right so that as i swing to the left i use his weight to leverage the door open and the door opens and so i run and i'm screaming i think but then i stop running because i realize very quickly he's not chasing me he's run away i don't know what it was in that moment if it was just the effects of the adrenaline but all i wanted to do was find him so that i could stab him and kill him but as i'm looking around i don't see anyone apart from an indian man standing in the driveway of his house next to his car he shouts to me are you okay course i'm not okay i've just been mugged which way did he go i start running down a dark road and the man chases me and brings me back telling me it's not a good idea he walks me to the phone box where i pick up my bag and i replace the handset and the phone rings and so for some bizarre reason i answer it it's my boyfriend he tells me he's been trying to call me for the last two minutes what are you sure i hang up and then the indian man offers to drive me home i tell him he's crazy i'm not getting in a car with you you're a stranger you're a man he offers to bring his wife along so that i feel safe it's just that now i have to wait for her because she has to get ready and get her purse so as i stand outside the door waiting for her every single member of the family appears at the door wanting to know what happened wanting to come along for the ride eventually everyone is seated in the car everyone except for me there's no room for me to sit someone has to get out of the car so that i can get in so that i can go home eventually it's agreed that the grandfather will stay behind the drive is excruciatingly slow owing to the weight of the car and so claustrophobic i burst into tears and the grandmother says stop crying what are you crying for it's not like you were raped oh wait a minute she says he didn't touch you down there did he no well that's alright then because otherwise you would've been spoiled we get to the car park and i ask to be let down they offer to walk me to my door and i flat out refuse and as i watch the car pull away {cg} i realize as i stand in this dark car park i'm breathing again and it's only in that moment i realize i'm home i made it home thank you
 i first started taking care of other people's children when i was actually still just a child myself so that meant people were paying me basically to play and that was really awesome but it also meant that i was getting a ton of childcare experience and that by the time i was sixteen i probably could make macaroni and cheese with my eyes shut or change a diaper with one hand tied behind my back which i only probably ever would have to do with those very naughty nicholson boys but uh their mother knew they were a handful she was paying ten dollars an hour in nineteen eighty eight so i kind of thought that all of my childcare experience was gonna teach me everything that i needed to know about parenting my own children and my husband and i we had a daughter and then a son and then we decided to become foster parents uh with the intention of hopefully being able to adopt one day and you know how everybody always says you need a license to drive a car but you don't need one to have a child that's not true when you become a foster parent we did have to get a license and so first we had to take these classes where they asked us really hard hitting questions like is secondhand smoke good or bad and um do babies actually need car seats and then we had to do uh all sorts of other things um have physicals done background checks fingerprinted have our home inspected interviews i mean the whole thing turned out to be way more complicated than just creating a new human being with my body and then there were all the questions what kind of child would we be willing to take a girl or a boy what race what age now i grew up with three sisters and i already had one boy that i didn't always know how to relate to but then i heard that boys are actually left behind more in adoption requests so we said that we preferred a boy any race and having survived two infants already we thought that that pleasure could be afforded to someone else so anything up to age four the age of our biological son at the time and we got our license in the mail and we settled in for what we thought could be a very long wait but we got a phone call six weeks later about a baby at the hospital and i thought wow an infant doesn't everybody else want an infant but we said yes and when we went to the hospital to pick him up the nurses insisted on pushing me out to the car in a wheelchair which i thought was very funny  i mean i didn't suffer any physical distress bringing this kid into the world and even though i thought it was really funny though i realized i was having the same exact overwhelmingly surreal sensation that i had when i first left the hospital with my first two babies and that was there's a new person here there's this new human being that's so tiny and perfect and amazing and this hospital staff is gonna let us just leave with him even though they look really confident and we got him home and it became obvious right away that there were things that we still needed to learn in spite of years of babysitting and parenting experience and having a license to parent like what to do when a young woman comes bouncing up to you and says your baby is so cute is his daddy black so i just uh pretended i couldn't really remember or what to do when a woman taps you on the shoulder at a crowded restaurant and demands to know where's that baby from and when told new jersey uh just continues to keep asking but where before that but where before that until you're finally just forced to say a uterus or what to do when your four year old white son comes running up and says we're playing circus and the baby has to be the monkey because he's brown and your african american case worker is visiting and all you can think to do is that you just wanna die on the spot and so instead you just pretend you didn't hear him and make a strong mental note to talk to him about that later i don't think they told us anything about transracial adoption in those classes uh the most they might have said was something along the lines of if you are white and have a black child placed with you please for the love of god get some help with their skin and hair and so i turned to my black friends and and i asked for help and they helped me and they also taught me things like that my little black boy was only gonna be cute in the eyes of the public for a certain age and then he would um somehow over night be perceived as threatening to the public and that it was gonna happen much sooner than i would anticipate and i listened to them and i learned from them but i didn't experience any of that harsh reality yet and our case moved along and we were given the go ahead to adopt him and i got some paperwork in the mail it was an adoption subsidy agreement and next to the name of our adorable funny very loved and very wanted son was the reason for the monthly subsidy that he was gonna get ah and it was checked off child is hard to place african american and i felt like i had been punched in the stomach and then one day we get a phone call from our case worker and i wasn't expecting it and i could tell something was up and i was right because she said do you have room for another baby and we weren't really planning on having any more children but um we loved our little son so much we loved any sibling of his and so i said what is it and she said a boy and so i cried a little when i said okay and then i said i guess i better call my husband and ask him real quick though so then we were up to four children one girl and three boys and i was pretty sure that i was done with babies but then i went to a baby shower and all the the new mom was opening up all these tiny little socks and really cute onesies and things and all the women were just gushing and i realize that i was sitting like a little bit away from the rest of them and just thinking that looks like more laundry to me so then i really knew that i was done with babies until i got a phone call about our boy's baby sister and could we come get her like today did we have a car seat and so even though we knew it meant getting on another two year emotional roller coaster we borrowed a car seat and said yes six years after starting our fostering experience we had adopted each of our children we got to say goodbye to the judges and the case workers and good riddance to the one that we referred to as the anti social worker and hello to the architect and contractors lessons were still being learned and mistakes were being made i can admit that i have been that white mom out at the store when a black woman told me that my baby's hair felt a little bit dry and i knew i i had to learn from all these different sources the the black community adult adopteest more experienced transracially adoptive families and all while trying to balance it with what it meant to be our family in this time and in this place and i thought we were doing alright and then one day my son was getting ready for school he was six years old and uh getting ready for first grade and he was brushing his teeth and he just stopped and he said i wish a brown family adopted me he he wasn't upset he was very matter of fact like i wanna wear my blue sneakers and i wish a brown family adopted me but i was stunned i knew he might say something like that at some point but i just wasn't really expecting it and so i uh just tried to stay calm and i said oh well how come and he said i want the family to look like me and so i pointed out that his younger brother and sister looked like him and he said yeah but not the whole family and so i just apologized i didn't know what else i could possibly do and i got him off to school and the whole day i was thinking you know what am i gonna do about this and on one hand i didn't wanna do anything i mean the kid seems fine i don't wanna bother him you know get him upset about it but on the other hand you know you have to muddle things up sometimes before you get some clarity so at bedtime that night i muddled things up and i asked him are you still feeling sad that a brown family didn't adopt you and he didn't say anything he just nodded yes so i said um did anybody do anything or say something recently that made you start to feel that way and again he just nodded no so now i'm grasping for straws um did you know that daddy and i love you very very very very very much and again just a nod yes i mean clearly the kid was not gonna help me move the conversation forward at all and so i i had no idea what to say and so i absolutely surprised myself with what came out next and i said to him did you know that there's sadness to adoption and this time his interest was piqued because this time he spoke and he said no i didn't and i said well yeah most of the time everybody only talks about how really happy adoption is and we are so so happy that you're part of our family but if the world was perfect and there were never any problems at all you probably could have just stayed with your first mommy don't you think and this time my boy answered me it wasn't with a nod or with words but he sobbed it wasn't crying over a skinned knee he was sobbing over an emotional wound that he didn't know he had and he still lacked the emotional maturity and the language to really explore it but there was something about my acknowledging it for him that just unlocked the deepest sob i'd ever heard come out of a little child and i told him it was okay to be sad about that and maybe even forever but that i wanted to help him find peace over it and would he maybe like to try to meet some more of his birth family and he said yes so i reached out to our last case worker and i i said i'd heard about this great grandma can you give me her number or something and he said no um i'm actually not allowed to give that out so i did a little more asking around and some research and i found out that he could however send a letter on my behalf now based on my history with the state i didn't really trust that this was gonna happen but i had to take a chance i wrote the letter and i sent it and hoped for the best and uh it worked because she called us a week or two later this great grandmother who had worried about them and prayed for them for years and we went to go meet her immediately and as soon as we did all these doors kept opening because every time we went we just would meet a new family member and each one of them welcomed all of us our adopted kids our biological kids my husband and myself with open arms and all these relationships that could have felt awkward or strained just never did and our children thrived because of it and that was four years ago and on a more recent visit i was sitting ca catching up with the kids' auntie like on a couch over here and i could see my husband eating and talking with another family member over there and some of my kids were doing crafts with some cousins and others were running around playing ninja turtles with other cousins and there was popop sitting on the couch and he had the tv on the nature channel way too loud like he always has it and i know that now and there was my son just snuggled up by his side and trading wild animal facts with his grandfather and looking around the room that day i thought to myself you know growing up i always thought that adoption just meant uh a new family for the children that are adopted but looking around here i know that in our case it means so much more because it uh it's a family for all of us
 a couple of weeks after i got my phone call from nasa that i was selected to be an astronaut my information packet came in the mail and the cover letter had a paragraph at the beginning that said congratulations and then there was the second paragraph and it said practice your swimming you will be required to pass a swim test in order to go to water survival training with the united states navy in pensacola and i could not believe this because after years of applications and interviews and medical examinations from head to toe and an extensive background check never once did anyone ever think to ask do you know how to swim and if they did my answer would have been not really although i grew up on long island and was surrounded by water my entire life i didn't like swimming and i completely hated the water i was a skinny little kid who was always freezing when i got wet and i didn't like having my head under the water i couldn't breathe i didn't like having chlorine in my eyes when i would go to a pool party i would go on my tippy toes just so my head was exposed and pretend like i was having a good time and now the one thing that i hated and avoided my entire life had now become the one thing that i had to do well and the one thing that was gonna stand between my me and my dream of flying in space i wasn't gonna let that stop me i had the summer to get ready i took my kids to the pool every day and i swam and i practice and i practice and i practice and at the end of that summer i reported for duty at the johnson space center a much better swimmer but still very very nervous about what i was going to have to do there and i reported there with forty three other new astronauts but we weren't really astronauts yet we were astronaut candidates or as our senior astronauts called us ass cans we were all forty four new ass cans and in our initial briefing they told us how we could grow up to be astronauts and they gave us a list of things that we were gonna be doing over the next two years all the different examinations and qualifications that we would net to net net have to get in order to do that and the very first test we were gonna have was the swim test and i was like really can't we have like a math quiz or a physics test and then the briefer went on and said okay all the strong swimmers in this class raise your hand and a couple of the military people raise their hand we had a navy diver raised her hand and then he asked okay all the weak swimmers raise your hands and be honest and i sheepishly raise my hand along with a couple other egghead phds you know yeah you know and he said great you strong swimmers and you weak swimmers this weekend you're gonna work together and you strong swimmers we gonna get these weak swimmers ready to pass the test that's exactly what we did and we showed up that next week all forty four of us to take this test in full gear flight suit boots and helmet and the feeling that day was everyone was gonna pass and we were not gonna leave that pool until everyone passed and we got in the water and we did our long distance swim uh demonstrating all the survival strokes that we needed to show we did a lap underwater we demonstrated that we could save each other do a rescue swim we drown proofed that mets we we got on our back with only our mouth exposed bringing in uh sips of air to fill our lungs so we get buoyancy on the water and then after you are good and tired from all that it was time to tread tread water and in the last few minutes of that tread they blew a whistle and you had to bring your hands out of the water and if your hands went underneath the water you failed and you had to do the whole test over again and as i'm treading for dear life with my hands out of the water those last few minutes i'm looking around at my new classmates i look for mike fink and don't see him anymore but i see his hands they didn't say anything about your head being out of the water they only said your hands had to be out of the water and by golly mike was not gonna let his hands go under that water and i realize just how determined this group of people was these people that i had now become classmates with future astronauts with every one of us passed everyone pass that test and a few weeks later we flew down to naval air station pensacola the home of naval aviation and for a kid who dreamt about being an astronaut and watched the right stuff a thousand times and read that book about a hundred times i was in heaven there were f eighteens with blue angels in them screaming overhead there were young navy and marine recruits exercising and running all over the place and then there was us and we were there to be trained to eject out of a high performance aircraft be able to work our parachute and our survival gear and survive in the water long enough for someone to come and get us now this is something that i would never dream of doing in a million years and i found out how the navy was gonna get us ready to do this you don't jump out of the plane the first day what you do is you take it step by step and they build you up inch by inch baby steps until you're ready to do the big exercise at the end of the week so what we started to do was get by the end of the pool just on the edge of the pool and jump in and then once you got that down you'd went on a platform about a foot off the water and you jump from there and you got progressively higher and then they told us how to go through our checklist once we get ejected from the aircraft make sure your canopy was good you needed a good canopy above your head and if you didn't have one they told you what to do to fix it and then you went through all your other checks make sure your mask is off your visor is up deploy your sea kit with all your survival gear and then make sure most important one most important things for me anyway was that your lpu your life preserver unit was inflated cuz that's what's gonna keep you floating when you hit the water and then pull three lines a three line jettison which allows you to steer the parachute and after you got into the water they told us how to get away from the parachute and how to release from it because that could fill with water and take you to the bottom of the ocean we did this step by step and the graduation exercise came at the end of that week what that was was gonna be a parasail above the gulf where we were going to release from the boat enter the water got to get out get into a raft signal for help and they would come pick us up and we had to do that twice and if you did that twice successfully you pass the water survival course that friday came and i'm out on the gulf of mexico on a platform ship getting ready to be hooked up to a cable they ka be taken parasailing for this final exam and my classmate right in front of me is stephanie wilson stephanie wilson is about five foot two and weighs about a hundred pounds stephanie wilson is about the size of one of my legs stephanie starts marching in place she gets a little tug from the boat takes about a step and off she goes like peter pan kay then he hook me up to the boat to the to the line and i'm really really nervous because not only am i scared of the water i am also afraid of heights yeah i know let it out an astronaut an astronaut who's afraid of heights i start marching in place just like they told me and then i start walking and i'm getting pulled and then i start walking faster and i start running and then i start thinking this boat is not infinitely long i get to the edge of the platform and i'm still removing my legs i haven't gotten airborne yet and i start going toward the ocean and i plunge and belly flop about twenty feet and do a face plant into the water and then the boat starts dragging me through the water and as i'm trying to gasp for air and look i see this chief petty officer our instructor in the back of that boat signaling to me telling me release from your chute release from your chute i release from the chute just like she told me then they come and get me and my lpu the thing that's supposed to save me the life preserver unit had popped on impact they had a navy doctor check me out and he turns to the chief petty officer and says he'll be okay and she looks to me and says that's good you still gotta do it twice that didn't count i get hooked up to the boat again i start marching i start running i hit the edge of the boat again and here comes round two with the water but this time i skim the water with my feet my sail inflates and i rise above the water and then i get a signal from the chief petty officer the green flags waving at me and that means to release from the boat and i do that and then i go through my checklist canopy visor mask sea kit lpu three line jettison and i steer myself down and i keep my eye on a horizon horizon horizon let it come wait for it wait for it i see the horizon coming up my feet get a little bit wet i release from my chute i do my survival exercise they come get me and i have to do it one more time and i can pass they hook me up again i march walk run drop don't get wet come up high and i pause for a moment and i looked around it was a beautiful day above the gulf that day i could see the coast of florida i could see the atlantic ocean and it hit me what i was doing what an extraordinary experience this had been the skinny kid from long island was going through water survival training as an astronaut candidate soon to be astronaut hopefully with the united states navy and i looked down at the boat and frantically the chief petty officer's waving the flag i release do the whole routine again land in the water and they come get me and i had this great feeling of accomplishment more than i ever had in my life i mean i had gone through some tough tests as a undergraduate at columbia it almost killed me to get through my qualifying exam for my phd at mit and to complete my dissertation but those things for some reason seem doable this was facing one of the greatest fears i had and i had to do this in order to achieve my dream of flying in space and i just felt like a superhero getting this done and then i realized i had become a good swimmer over those months of practicing and going through the swim test and all these lessons and the navy i had become a really good swimmer i had swim goggles i had a bathing suit i could maybe do this for exercise for the rest of my life since that day over the gulf of mexico twenty years ago i have never swim another lap
so i'm sitting in my shrink's office this one time and he says to me how's it going and i say well to be honest doc i had a really really horrible experience the other day and he says tell me about it and i say well it all started when i was i was laying on my couch and he looks at me and he says really which if you know me is an incredibly funny thing for him to say because i i have probably spent more time lying on couches than any able bodied man under the age of say a hundred and ten living today uh if lying on couches was a martial art i would have a ninth level black belt ninja master status in it um i uh as a matter of fact when i i was originally asked by the moth to do this event and they explained about the seven deadly sins i was amazed that sloth was even still available uh i i i assumed that sloth would be the first sin picked because it is really the central thing about our culture isn't it it's which is all we live we live in a whole society based on consumer entertainment and sort of luxury effort reduction um but within that culture my own generation which they used to call gen x or slackers really distinguidich distinguished itself even among you know the the the general culture and within that elite group of of underachievers i distinguish myself as really a super achiever of underachievement um if if sloth is a sin i am i think it's fair to say i am i'm really guilty of like milosevic level crimes against humanity and um and if if the if the vatican conducted its affairs the way that governments do there there would be some sort of secret vatican sniper up in these windows ready to take me out right now um i lived for years and years and years in uh just bumming around this luh wonderful college town called madison wisconsin and um do people know madison great that's fantastic and we had a whole culture there that was essentially built around couches um everything was centered around the living room because what your life consisted of was every second that you weren't slaving away at your shitty mini minimum wage job and that's i'd like to dispel a myth about slackers right now which is that they don't work hard because in order to live this life of sloth you really have to work like a slave to do it because opting out of the career rat race essentially means opting into the working poor you know and and and um and so every second that you weren't at that job you were sitting in your living room sitting with your friends you're watching tv you're smoking pot you're listening to rock and roll and watching dvds and but but but mainly just engaging in conversation and you're trying to wring every last ounce of leisure of luxury effort reduction out of the remaining hours before your shift at the job you hate starts again um we had a wonderful tradition in madison because every year the s when the students would move the frat guys would leave their furniture aba abandoned by the side of the road and so every year you would take the cigarette hole burned beer stained vomit smelling couch that just stank like weed and cigarettes and you would pick it up and you'd march it out of the house and you'd set it down and then you'd go get a brand new couch from the frat kids and you'd move it into the empty space where you had the previous couch and you'd set it down and you'd have a wonderful new couch to abuse for the following year now one of the things i did during all these years of slacking in madison was i was writing jokes for the onion and to my great surprise that eventually turned into a career and i and no one could've been more surprised about it than me believe me and we i ended up moving to new york and for the first time i had money so i was incredibly excited because i was not only going to be able to live this life of slack but i was gonna be able to live it in style and i set up this wonder i got this a wonderful apartment in brooklyn this nice living room and i s filled it with with uh seating i bought a s i bought a surround sound home theater and i got a dvd player for it i got a big tv and and and i got a fantastic number for great connection with a just top notch weed delivery service and um and and the best thing is i bought this fantastic it was the couch of my dreams at this vintage store i spent five hundred dollars on it only couch i ever spent money on in my life and um and i was so looking forward to all the wonderful times i was gonna to have with all of these great new friends i was gonna make in new york but what i didn't understand was that new york is not like madison it's not a living room based town because all of the you know lower east side you know downtown bohemians that i was wanting to hang out with they don't have living rooms they they they have a box with a bed and a refrigerator and a toilet and a shower and a sink and that's what that's where they live and so in the lieu of hanging out in living rooms they hang out in bars and restaurants now and and and for that reason it's also not a marijuana town it's an alcohol town so i've had to learn to drink and i'm i'm getting pretty good at it to be honest but um but uh you know nuh none of those things really matter if like me you live in brooklyn but people from manhattan won't go to brooklyn because it's a twenty minute ride on the train and they're busy spending forty to eighty minutes waiting to get into the cool restaurant or bar so the upshot of all this is i spend about the next five years of my life in the ultimate slack pad i've created surrounded by empty seats alone playing video games watching dvds by myself surrounded by empty seating and what's worse is the is is that my my dvd player even mocks me because whenever you hit stop a screen saver comes on with their consumer entertainment you know home theater slogan that says everyone's invited everyone's invited every day everyone's invited but you're here by yourself aren't you over the years the combined effects of a gravity b time and c my ass on this couch literally destroy my dream couch the part of the couch where my ass is centered has collapsed completely there's like there's like springs and metal falling out the bottom stuffing is falling out the bottom i have to it's ch it's there's just a hole where my ass is i have to i have to fill it up with pillows and and blankets and put a board over it just to continue to lay on it now at this point in the story i'm sure that those of you in the audience with even a remote sense of insight into the human condition are probably thinking to yourself well you know these stories are all kinda cute anecdotes and they're a little bit funny but i have another interpretation of everything this man on stage is saying and it sounds kinda to me like he's describing the behavior of someone who is not to put too fine a point on it clinically depressed and you would be right i i happen to have been clinically depressed pretty much my entire adult life which brings us back to why i was sitting in my shrink's office in the first place telling him about this horrible experience so he says tell me about it i say i'm laying on the couch and it was one of those days when you've run out of all the distractions available in the living room like i had watched all the dvds i had finished all the video games i had masturbated to all of the available pornography uh the i smoked all the drugs there was nothing left and i had a moment of s zen stillness and clarity where i was face to face with myself and i looked in myself and i saw this horrific nightmarish void of nothingness it was just this swirling vortex of empty zero there was nothing there i felt like i had no future no past no options no hope like there was nothing to believe in and at this point my shrink cuts me off and he says todd todd wait wait hold on right now i'm hearing a lot of negativity from you i mean you're just describing a a horrible descent into nihilism and i give him this look like well duh you know and i say yeah the reason you're hearing that is cause that's what i'm telling you and he says well todd but that's very serious nihilism is a terrible place to end up bad things happen to people that go there you can drown in that shit so i say well let me tell you do i hear a cell phone is that what that is so i tell him maybe someone's just giving me a little hip hop background to this so eh i tell him well let me finish the story have you ever been so depressed that you just can't get out of bed or you just can't get out of your chair and you just end up relying on whatever's in arm's reach of you you know and so i'm sort of groping around the couch just for a just looking for something anything to distract me from this horrible emptiness that i'm experiencing and i reach under the couch and i find this old paperback book that has been kicked under there probably a couple of months earlier and i pull it out and it's the ultimate perfect book for lifting someone out of their own personal hell  happens to be swear to god this is true not making this up dante's inferno so so i'm like i obviously cannot handle reading dante's inferno right now but lacking anything else to do i decide i'm gonna read the foreword so the foreword is written by some scholar of medieval italian epic poetry or whatever and i start reading it and i say to my doc as as reading it i learned a new word he says what was it and i said well the word is acedia i'd never heard of this word before he says what does it mean i said well it was the medieval catholic's word for the profound sense of emptiness that comes from not believing in anything they saw it as a sin uh and s specifically uh the sin of the failure they defined it as the failure to pursue god in other words a a lack of making the effort necessary to seek out the joy of god or more generally of of creation and it was considered so dangerous that they actually numbered it among the seven deadly sins acedia and i by the way i don't know if it's actually pronounced acedia because i'm a college dropout i don't know how to pronounce ancient latin granted i knew i was gonna be speaking in front of a couple hundred people i probably could've googled it and figured out the pronunciation but i was too lazy so um and at this point i can tell you know i can tell that that my shrink is is is a little uncomfortable with how the conversation's going because he doesn't like talking about sin he doesn't like sin doctrine based modes of behavioral modification because he's a shrink and shrinks are always against thinking about things in terms of sin because sin is always about guilt and a shrink's job is to get people to get over guilt so he's kinda trying to change the subject but what i say to him is the amazing thing about this is that in modern times it's usually translated or mistranslated if you will as sloth because it involves a a lack of effort but the idea is you know when when when we hear sloth now i mean you it just seems like laziness it's not that big of a sin it's not deadly but they but they were talking about something far more serious they were talking about a deep existential despair thanks and and i realized as i was talking to them that if i'm guilty of acedia then so is our whole consumer entertainment prozac taking depressed out of their mind nation and i figured there's two ways of looking at it either we should be very grateful that ancient catholic doctrine doesn't still dominate the intellectual world because if so then me and the whole nation are all just guilty unredeemable sinners and can be written off but the second way of looking at it that's perhaps a little more productive is that this was a way of looking at my depression that didn't involve me being a helpless victim of a sickness defined by a condition and that i might have some degree of of personal responsibility for my own state of mind so my shrink looks at me and he doesn't say anything for a very long time because he doesn't like how the conversation's going but on the other hand he's a smart guy so he's thinking very very intently and finally he looks up at me and he says that's very interesting what are you gonna do about it and i look back at him and i say hmmmmmm thank you
where i grew up in the south there was a right way to do things and a wrong way to do things and the right way was to do what your family and society thought you should do and the wrong way was to do something different by age thirty i had done most everything i was supposed to do i'd overachieved in high school i attended a prestigious college in the south i had a good job and i'd married well within the child bearing age we'd married at my insistence of course but neither one of us was fully on board so except for moving up north to boston which caused my family to collectively take to their beds i was on track with what we thought my life should look like but i wasn't happy and i thought it was my career {ls) in my family i was expected to go into business i had been in public relations for seven years but i didn't like the work anymore i mean i was good at it but i was tired of working with clients and plus i was working with companies like retail banking traffic reporting hazardous waste recycling nothing that really blew my skirt up so i quit my full time job and i started consulting and i started taking classes to figure out what else i could do for a living now the only criterion for the classes was that the instructors and students could not know or care what the financial times was i took needlepoint directing french i found this brochure for the school of the museum of fine arts in boston and i thought oh well this looks interesting and i went to the school and i talked to the continuing education director and i asked him which class he thought i should take and he said you need to take art as process we take burned out executives in that class all the time i sign up it's my first day of art school i do my best to look artsy to fit in but even though i am not wearing pearls they are still emblazoned on my chest and our instructor rhoda introduces herself and she says there is no right way to make art and there is no wrong way to make art now this makes me extremely nervous because i have been raised that there is a right way and a wrong way to do most everything and then she says the class will focus on process the process of art making not the end result now this makes me even more nervous because i have been raised to focus on results and not just any results but the best results and there are no grades things careen out of control if there are no grades how will i know if i'm overachieving i need to know that i'm overachieving we start with the basics and in my entire life i had never held a stick of charcoal in my hand and it feels good and i survived the first week of simple art exercises and i'm enjoying myself and the next week bob one of the three instructors says today we're gonna do gesture drawings very fast drawings about forty five second poses and we're going to draw the energy and the movement and the essence of the figure and i am thinking what the heck is essence and how the heck do you draw it and a man the artists model starts to undress and i say well that's okay you've seen a naked man before you've even had sex with a naked man before your problem is you don't know how to draw this naked man's essence and everybody else apparently does know how to draw his essence as they're all busily getting out their easels and knowingly getting out sheets of paper and charcoal and other drawing mediums with which they excel and i'm just standing there like the proverbial deer in headlights and i begin to watch and imitate because i am clueless but competitive and so i ask judy who is standing next to me and also a mature student i say judy what are these supposed to look like because of course i think there's only one right way to do this and we're all gonna draw the same image and she looks at me bewildered and says they're all going to look different i'm paralyzed what is mine supposed to look like can't i just do a slide presentation for your board of directors maybe conduct a communications audit assess your customer service capabilities these are things i know how to do things in which i excel and i like to excel and there is no way i'm gonna excel drawing this naked man's essence and i'm about to cry and then the competitive side of me kicks in and says well just snap out of it you big wimp and do something so i start making these hopeless stick figures every forty five seconds because that's how fast the poses are every forty five seconds and every forty five seconds i feel like a total failure which is a lot of times in one hour it's eighty and the shame is enormous and i'm mortified at how inept i am and i'm like beating myself up for ever trying anything different for even attempting anything new and i'm in literal physical pain i am so far out of my comfort level i mean i actually hurt and i'm about to cry again and that's when bob comes over and shows me what amazing teachers can do i don't even know what he says all i know is he talks me off the ledge and breaks the vice grip that has a hold of me and i start to draw at the end of class bob picks one of my gesture drawings to put up on the wall with a bunch of other student drawings so we can discuss them no one laughs at me or my drawing it actually holds its own i have drawn a naked man and i feel like i can do anything but things at home start to get a little tricky my husband is an art director one of the reasons why i married him i loved being with somebody artsy he seemed so exotic and interesting he was the creative one and i was the business one but when i started going to art school all the roles were off the balance of power completely out of sync so class continues for the next six weeks and it's an emotional roller coaster i mean my thinking is shifting and breaking apart and i cry every day and my final assignment is a wall installation which is a term i didn't know existed six weeks before and it includes these three wall sculptures these sculptures made out of the new york times business sections and the wall street journal all painted black and they're bound in these really tight boxes and each piece gets progressively more undone until the final piece explodes and bob the instructor that talked me off the ledge sees it and he says tricia you know you really ought to apply to the museum school well this thought had never occurred to me before i mean in the back of my mind i'm gonna end up in business school that this is a once in a lifetime event i go back to my normal life and i'm highly suspicious and then it occurs to me what's happening he's hitting on me i have no artistic talent at all he's just flattering me until he can get lucky and this theory sticks until i find out he's been in a committed relationship for the past eighteen years with his boyfriend so then i start thinking of other reasons why they may want me to apply maybe they think i have a lot of money and i'll be a big donor cause i was working at harvard business school at the time or maybe they think i know people who will be big donors and so while i'm using all of my creative energy trying to imagine why i'm not creative charles one of the instructors comes up to me and says tricia you really ought to apply to the museum school i mean you know you're an artist you're one of us panic begins to set in and i enroll in art school as a part time student but i'm still consulting and i'm both excited and traumatized because for the first time in my life i am not following the rules and i say to my dear friend sarah who's also a southerner i say sarah i am so afraid of being different than everybody else and she says oh tricia i'm so afraid of being just like everybody else and my marriage begins to explode and part of the reason is i'm not supposed to excel beyond men definitely not beyond my husband but i have places i wanted to go and he just wasn't moving fast enough i kept pushing him to move faster so i could move forward and one day he just says to me tricia you just want me to go places i don't wanna go at art school since we don't have grades we have review boards and at the end of each semester we put up all the work we've done and two instructors and several students review the work give us feedback and guide us on our creative path and i'm driving to my review board in the jeep i've purchased for the yet to be conceived children i assume i'll have but instead it's piled high with artwork and at my review board one of the students writes this on his review board sheet you seem to be a little frantic very perceptive it has something to do with control it's okay to let go you're expecting this to be black or white but the process won't allow that you've got to let go i'm not sure if he's talking about my artwork or my marriage my husband and i separate and a dear friend of mine says you know tricia i love my husband and i love my children but i never thought i had options you have options and she's right because even though my life is blowing apart or maybe because it is i begin to really find my voice and step into my artwork my mother sees it and says why is it so dark why aren't there any heads it's getting harder and harder to do my consulting work and even though i'm getting paid a fire hose of cash i know that if i do this work for much longer i'm gonna die slowly but i'm gonna die and i realize i'm not just in the wrong job or the wrong marriage i'm in the wrong life i don't want to do what other people want me to do or think i should do anymore all i want is to make art i'm an artist and the week we separate they tear down my family home of twenty five years and my jeep gets stolen i have this keychain with three keys on it one to the house i don't live in anymore one to my family home that's been torn down and one to my jeep that's been stolen god is banging on my hood so i toss the keys head to art school and join my tribe
so i'm not depressed now but i was depressed for a long time and i wrote about being depressed and i lived for a long time with blinding depression and had long stretches when everything seemed hopeless and pointless when returning calls from friends seemed like more than i could do when getting up and going out into the world seemed painful when i was completely crippled with anxiety and when i finally got better and started writing about the process of recovery i became very interested in all of the different kinds of treatment that there were for depression and having started as a kind of medical conservative thinking that there were only a couple of things that worked medication and certain talking therapies and that that was really it i very gradually began to change my mind because i realized that if you have brain cancer and you decide that standing on your head and gargling for half an hour every day makes you feel better it may make you feel better but the likelihood is that you still have brain cancer and you're still going to die from it but if you have depression and you say that standing on your head and gargling for half an hour makes you feel better then you are actually cured because depression is an illness of how you feel and if you feel really great after you do that then you're not depressed any more but i began to think all kinds of things could work and i researched everything ranging from experimental brain surgeries to hypnotic ruh regimens of various kinds i had people writing to me because i had been publishing on this subject there was one woman who wrote to me and she said that she had tried actually electroshock treatments and a variety of other approaches to depression medication and therapy and she had finally found the thing that worked for her and she wanted me to tell the world about it and that was making little things from yarn um some of which she sent me and none of which i'm wearing right now but in any event uh tha i had that um uh that rich engagement and i also became interested as i was doing this work in the idea that depression existed not only in the civilized west as people tended to perceive it to exist but actually across cultures and had existed across time and so when one of my dearest friends my friend david hecht who was living for a little while in senegal said to me do you know about the tribal rituals that are used for the treatment of depression here i said no i don't know about them but i would like to know about them and he said well if you come for a visit we could try to do some research on this topic and so i set off for senegal and i met david and i was introduced to david's then girlfriend now ex wife elene and um it turned out that elene had a cousin whose mother was a friend of someone who went to school with the daughter of a person who actually practiced the ndepp and that i could therefore go and interview this woman who had practiced the ndepp and so we went off to um a small town about two hours outside of dakar and uh i was introduced to this extraordinary old large woman wrapped in miles and miles of african fabric printed with figures of eyes and she was madame diof and we did an interview for about an hour and she told me all about the ndepp and at the end of it feeling rather daring i said um listen i said i i hope i i don't know whether this is something you would even consider i said but would it be possible for me to attend an ndepp and she said well i certainly never had a foreigner the local word was toobob i've never had a foreigner attend one of these before she said but actually she said i mean you've come through these friends and these connections she said yes the next time i perform an ndepp you may be present and i said that's fantastic i said when are you next gonna be doing an ndepp and she said oh it'll be some time in the next six months and i said six months is quite a long time for me to stay here in this town waiting for you to do one i said is there anyone who might maybe we could expedite one for somebody move it forward um i'll pitch in um she said no it really doesn't work that way she said i'm sorry but um uh that that's that's how it is and i said well i guess i won't be able to see an ndepp then but even so this conversation has been so interesting and so] helpful to me and and i i'm a little sad leaving here about not actually getting to see one but but i thank you and she said well i'm i'm glad that you could come i'm glad it was helpful and she said um but there is one other thing she said uh i i hope you don't mind my saying this and i said well no what what is it and she said you don't look that great yourself she said are you you are suffering from depression and i said well yes i said i i was very acute it's kind of a little better now but yeah i still do actually suffer from depression she said well i've certainly never done this for a toobob before but i could actually do an ndepp for you and i said oh i said what an what an interesting idea i said well um yes uh sure yeah abso yes let's let's let's do that i said that i'll have an ndepp and she said oh well that's great she said and she gave us some uhh um uhh some sort of fairly basic instructions and then we left and my translator the aforementioned then girlfriend now ex wife of my friend turned to me and she said are you completely crazy do you have any idea what you're getting yourself into and i said well you know i'm i'm all these things very interesting she said you're crazy she said you're totally crazy but i'll help you if you want so we had left and the first thing we had was a shopping list there had been a she had k you could get them to buy the stuff but you had to pay a surcharge i'd said no we'd buy the stuff so we had to go out we had to buy seven yards of african fabric um we had to get um a calabash which was a large bowl fashioned from a gourd we had to get um three kilos of millet we had to get sugar we had to get kola beans and then we had to get two live cockerels two roosters and a ram um and so elene and i went to the market with david and with these other um people and we got most of the things and i said well but what what about the the ram and elene said we can't buy the ram today what are we gonna do with it overnight so i saw the sense of that so the next day the next day we got into a taxi to go back out two hours to where we were going and i said what about the ram and elene said oh we'll see a ram along the way so we were going along and going along and there was a senegalese shepherd by the side of the road with his flock and we stopped the cab and we got out and we bought the ram for seven dollars and then we had a little bit of a struggle getting the live ram into the trunk of the taxi cab um so but the cab driver seemed not at all worried even by the fact that the ram kept relieving himself in the trunk of the taxi cab um and so then we got to um rufisque and we got there i said well here i am i'm ready um for my close up and uh the thing about the ndepp is that it varies enormously depending on a whole variety of signals and symbols that come from above so we had to go through this whole shamanistic process and i still didn't know really very much of what was gonna happen so first i had to change out of my jeans and my t shirt and put on a loincloth and then i sat down and then i had my chest and my arms rubbed with millet and then um which is a grain and then someone said oh we really should have music um for this and i said oh great and i thought you know drumming i thought some atmospheric thing and she came out with her very prized possession which was a battery operated tape player for which she had one tape which was chariots of fire so we started listening to chariots of fire and in the meanwhile i was given sort of various shamanistic objects i had to hold with my hands and drop them i had to hold them with my feet and drop them i had to they would sort of say oh this augers well this augers badly there were five assistants to madame diof who had all gathered around and we sort of spent the morning like this and it was all really um just fine and then um they said it was maybe we'd started at about eight maybe about eleven eleven thirty they said well now it's actually time for the the central part of the ritual and i said oh ok and the sound of drumming began the drumming i'd been hoping for the drumming began and so there was all of this drumming and it was very exciting and we um went to the central square of the village where there was a small makeshift wedding bed that i had to get into with the ram um and i had been told it would be very very bad luck if the ram escaped and that i had to hold onto him and that the reason we had to be in this wedding bed was that all my depression and all my problems were caused by the fact that i had spirits in senegal you have spirits sort of all over you the way here you sort of have microbes some are good for you some are bad for you some are neutral anyway my bad spirits were extremely jealous of my real life sexual partners um some of whom are here tonight and um uh and that we had to um mollify the anger of the um of the spirits so i had to get into this wedding bed with the ram and i had to hold the ram very tightly because he he was not having a good life this ram um and he of course immediately relieved himself on my leg and the entire village had taken the day off from their work in the fields and were dancing around us in concentric circles and as they danced throwing blankets and sheets of cloth over us and so we were gradually being buried and it was unbelievably hot and it was completely stifling and there was the sound of these stamping feet as everyone danced around us and then these drums which were getting louder and louder and more ecstatic and more ecstatic and i was just about at the point at which i thought i was gonna faint or pass out at that key moment um suddenly all of the cloths were pulled off i was yanked to my feet the loincloth that was all i was wearing was pulled from me the poor old ram's throat was slit um as were the throats of the two cockerels and i was covered in the blood of the freshly slaughtered ram and the cockerels um and so there i was naked totally covered in blood and they said okay that's the end of this part of it and um i said well okay and they said um but uh you uh uh they said we're actually we but there's uh the next piece comes now and i said ok and we went over back to the area where we'd done the morning preparations and one of them said but look it's it's kind of lunch time why don't we just take a break for a minute would you like a coke i i don't drink coke that much but at that moment it seemed like a really really really good idea and i said yes and so i sat there naked and completely covered in animal blood um with flies kind of gathering as they will when you're naked and covered in animal blood and i i drank this coke and then when i had finished the coke they said ok now we have the sort of final parts of the ritual they said um so first you have to put your your hands by your sides and and hold your stand very straight and very erect and i said oh okay and then they tied me up with the intestines of the ram um and in the meanwhile it was hanging from a nearby tree and they were there was someone sort of doing some butchering of it and they took various little bits of it out and then i had to kind of shuffle over all tied up in in intestines which most of you probably haven't done but it's hard um i had to shuffle over and i had to take these little pieces of the ram and i had to dig holes and i had to put the pieces of the ram in the holes and i had to say something what i had to say was actually to me incredibly strangely touching in the middle of this weird experience i had to say spirits leave me alone to complete the business of my life and know that i will never forget you and i thought what a kind thing to say to the evil spirits you're exorcising that i'll never forget you and i haven't so anyway there were various other little bits and pieces that followed i was given a piece of paper in which all of the millet from the morning had been gathered i was told that the next morning i i should sleep with it under my pillow and in the morning get up and give it to a beggar who had good hearing and no deformities and that when i gave it to him that would be the end of my troubles and then the women sort of all filled their mouths with water and began spitting water all over me which it turns out is the sort of you know it's the surround shower effect and rinsing the blood away from me and it gradually came off and when i was clean they gave me back my jeans and everyone danced and they barbecued the ram and we had this dinner and i felt so up i felt so up it had it had been quite an astonishing experience even though i didn't believe in the animist principles behind it all of these people had been gathered together cheering for me and it was very exhilarating and i had a very odd experience five years later when i was working on my current book and i was in rwanda doing something else altogether and i got into a conversation with someone there and i described the experience i'd had in senegal and he said oh you know we have something that's a little like that he said that's west africa this is east africa it's quite different but there are some similarities um in some rituals here he said you know we had a lot of trouble with western mental health workers who came here immediately after the genocide and we had to ask some of them to leave and i said but what was the problem and he said okay they came and their practice did not involve being outside in the sun like what you're describing which is after all where you begin to feel better there was no music or drumming to get your blood flowing again when you're depressed and you're low and you need to have your blood flowing he said there was no sense that everyone had taken the day off so that the entire community could come together to try to lift you up and bring you back to joy he said there was no acknowledgement the depression as something invasive and external that could actually be cast out of you again he said instead they would take people one at a time into these dingy little rooms and have them sit around for an hour or so and talk about bad things that had happened to them he said we had to get them to leave the country thank you
 hi i grew up in providence rhode island and for my entire childhood we were never more than twenty miles away from the core of our universe the kennedys we were irish they were irish we were catholic they were catholic they were family we were like the relatives that they never got to see but we knew you know they're busy and we knew that they loved us so anything so anything that was happening to them was also happening to us so their tragedy plus our own tragedy was a lot so this one thanksgiving after dinner and a family fight at grandma's house um we were in the car and were driving home and the radio was playing this tenth uh anniversary of the jfk assassination and i'm sitting in the back seat and i start to cry and my sister erin says hey dad mikayla's crying and my father pulls that car right over to the shoulder of i ninety five he stops it he turns around and he looks at us and with tears in his own eyes he says don't you ever be ashamed to cry for that man so my parents grew up near newport and they got married in the same exact churc as church as jack and jackie saint mary's and my father gave exact replica jewelry to my mother that was replications of the jewelry that jack gave to jackie and every saturday night after mass my family would be in the living room and we'd be happily ever aftering to the original soundtrack of camelot and every year during the seventies my four aunts would take me and my two cousins on their dream vacation a rented beach house in hyannis on the very cove sharing beachfront with the kennedy compound every day for an entire week my aunt pat would roll up her sisters' hair my aunts would apply sunscreen to the back of their necks the backs of the hands and the tops of their feet and then they would drag their beach chairs down to the beach and they would set them up perfectly not facing the water not into the sun for tanning but perfectly for spying on the kennedys they would sit there all day in the broiling sun with high powered binoculars and keep a constant surveillance and every year they'd have the same exact conversations usually around mid morning the first sighting would be made usually by my aunt pat she'd be ah they got rose out walking ethel looks drawn and then about an hour later my aunt gurt would say how old is rose now and aunt momo would make the calculations well let's see jack died in sixty three when she was seventy four and rose's birthday was two weeks last thursday and joe died in sixty nine making her a widow at eighty one so eighty five and then they'd break for lunch so after lobster and drawn butter and hosing us down they'd all huffle back to their posts and they'd watch and every now and then there'd be something they didn't know hey who's that who's that who's that so they draw out the family tree in the sand they'd analyze it they'd come up with a profile and they'd crack the code it's one of bobby's now any mention of bobby would always bring up the inevitable oh i just pray to god they don't tell poor senile rose about bobby it'll break her so then the long afternoon stretch would end with the inevitable annual observation you don't see jackie much here and then all of my aunts would drop their binoculars and look at each other meaningfully now all of this meant that no one was paying any attention to me and my cousins in the water and the summer when we were nine years old we found something now had an aunt perhaps in an effort to ease a cramp in her prying neck just sort of glanced towards the water she might have seen us climbing into this tiny plastic half inflated boat she might have cried out in alarm at the lack of oars and life vests she might have had a conniption fit to see us shove off and drift into the violent riptide that would sweep us within five minutes out to the open sea and the nantucket bound ferry but an aunt didn't and we did it all happened so fast that we were swept out and it wasn't until we realized that we could make out the specific features of the ferry passengers that we were really far from shore we were so far from shore that my aunts were now reduced to four hopping dots uh oh it was like gilligan's island for real so an atlantic swell crashes over our heads and as soon as the water clears out of our eyes a power boat pulls up out of nowhere and in this power boat are david and michael kennedy so david and michael pull us up into the boat and we are like oh my god we are saved by a power boat so the power boat sends us back to shore and we're psyched cause we're saved until we start to watch the four hopping dots morph back into our four crazed livid aunts we are so gonna get it  now my family under any circumstances has this really weird thing well they each have like their own weird thing about like yelling and getting into huge trouble like my aunt gurt like she gets so freaked out that all she can do is yell out our addresses like ilene and kevin two seventy five hooper street mikayla one eighty asylum road i swear to god i grew up on asylum road um very telling piece of my childhood um or in my aunt pat would do these things where she would say these things that were like actually kind of nice things but she'd say them like they were death threats she'd be like yeah i'll save you from drowning you get on that beach towel and you lie in that sun now or she'd say i'm gonna buy you a birthday present you eat that cake now so we knew that this was what was coming the kennedy boys didn't so they're vivaciously tanned and they pull up to the shoreline and we brace ourselves now what happens is our aunts are out of their minds they're ready to flay us but when they see us in the same boat as the kennedys it's like they don't have the emotional capacity to handle it they kinda snap they're kinda like freaking out to yell at us but they start fake smiling and trying to act all normal and my aunt momo she's like takes on this like kennedy esque way of speaking which is sort of halfway between katherine hepburn and like the queen of england and we're like looking at them like what are you guys doing and they're smiling this smile but when they smile at us it's like you just wait but they're like oh david oh michael thank you thank you thank you and they're not mad at us for almost drowning they're mad at us because the kennedys had to save us like don't those people have enough trouble now you like as if our almost drowning was yet another kennedy tragedy so these poor boys finally pull and pry themselves away from my aunts they get back on the boat and they're leaving and my aunt momo's going please give our best to your grandmother and now it's time for our for real punishment which was that we for the rest of vacation had to stay on the beach because we did not have any respect for the water so it's a hundred degrees out and after about a half hour of whining and fighting and like um emptying out all the coppertone and kicking sand we break my aunt pat's last nerve and she says alright you can go in the water but only up to your knees so we're happy for a minute until we get in the water and realize how boring up to your knees is and then we get the great plan of having chicken fights so we start to have chicken fights but it's kinda weird because there's only three of us so but we're doing the best we can to have a chicken fight like that and like knock each other off into the water so we get fully immersed and then my uncle al who never ever played with us ever comes into the water to play chicken fights with us and he puts his daughter my cousin ilene up on his shoulders and then i get up on my cousin kevin's shoulders and we're having chicken fights and it's like actual family fun for a moment and we're like you know hitting each other falling in the water and then i take my foot and i accidentally kick the side of my uncle al's head really really hard and his eyeball pops out of his head falls into the water and sinks it pops out of his head and it sinks ilene kevin and i are in instant complete shock right this minute there is still a part of me that is on that beach screaming it's like oh my god we had no idea that he had a fake eye we didn't even know that you could have a fake eye why would you have a fake eye they did'nt tell us that you that uncle al had a fake eye cause they didn't want us blabbing it to the whole neighborhood so they didn't tell us so we didn't know and like later on you know there was columbo and sandy duncan but this was way before that we had no idea so we're all standing there and it's like so horrible like i can't even like i'm like oh my god and and my cousins ilene and kevin are staring at me with complete hate like you broke our dad and my uncle al is standing there and he's got the lid open so you can like see inside the socket where now it's just like skin and the eyeball gone and like you cannot just say i'm sorry to someone that you just so i don't know what to do and my aunt pat is hysterically screaming because that eyeball cost top dollar it was a special magnetized eye so it could keep up with the other one and now i had just better pray that vacation was over and that they got that deposit back because now they were gonna have to buy a brand new top dollar eye that was not in the budget so i just didn't know what to do i was like my life is over i am no longer mikayla i am now merce girl who kicked al's eye out in the cape and it's awful and everybody's just crying and pointing at me and now my other aunts are getting in on it like in who's the blame part of the conversation's happening so i just kind of back off into the water i'm kinda like going back and like regressing back to like where life as i once knew it had ended and i just stand there and like i kinda wish i had drowned and i kinda wish the kennedys hadn't saved me and i bent off and into the waves and i just i just start like sifting through sand and shells and pebbles and it's totally ridiculous but like i will never stop looking for this eye i am gonna look forever and i keep looking and looking and i'm sifting through and then all of a sudden there is an eyeball in my palm fa staring right at me and so i scream and i drop it back and it sinks back into the water but now we know it's possible so everybody gets back into the water and now we're all sifting through and sifting through and i pray to god for no more future happiness until we find this eye and i also kinda pray that it not be me the one that finds it this time so after like an hour my cousin kevin finds the eye and he holds it up in triumph and he does not let go and my uncle al takes the eye he like washes it off and just pops it back in and then he kinda like tests it you know and it's like keeping up with the other one so it's working still and now it's the weirdest thing because now we know it's a fake eye and now that you know it's a fake eye it's totally looks like a fake eye and i can't believe that i never noticed it wasn't a fake eye before so now vacation's back on and so everybody gets back in their beach chairs and they start to settle down to begin telling the story over and over like a million times about what i just did and i have not really fully reintegrated back into the family yet i'm kind of standing apart and i notice that there actually has been like kind of a group of people who have been watching this whole thing and then i see something that i didn't notice that no one noticed and that's that two of the kennedy kids david and michael had taken a walk on the beach and i can tell just by the look on thier faces that they had sit there and seen the entire episode that they had been there watching us thank you
 so as i sit down to eat from this spread that has been given in my honor i can't help but to f notice the two feelings that i'm having one i'm a little nervous two i'm very excited because you see in the morning i'll be paroling from state prison after twenty six years this spread is given to me not as like to say hey homie we appreciate you nah it was a spread to say we don't never wanna see your ass in here again and they broke out the finest of the finest top ramen chili in a can uh roast beef in a can you know this this top line of stuff right so after the spread has been had it's time for me to give away some property such as my tv my radio and some self help books that helped me a lot so they'll be better utilized left behind nine o'clock rolls around it's lights out you don't have to go to sleep but you do gotta get off the day room floor it's cool by me i'm leaving in the morning so i may have gotten like three hours worth of sleep that night i slept ready roll and that means i slept with my clothes on so once they call my name i'm out of there bye see you later so five forty five rolls around the night man says cyprien d thirty seven eighty seven five report to r and r i walk down that corridor for the last time walk the one gate after another till i get to r and r and that's receiving and release and i'm on the release end at this point i get to r and r and there's about seven to six other guys waiting for the same thing they start fingerprinting me mugshots and everything i'm cool like time to go so they load us on a van and we drive through one gate after another gate till we get to the final gate the cop says alright everybody off the van you'll step to the man at the base of the tower there and you'll give him some personal information so we did and he gave each man an envelope with two hundred dollars in it better known as gate money we all got back onto the van and drove through that last gate we made it around to the visitor's parking lot and he asked is there anyone with a ride i do i was the only one to get off the van these other guys that two hundred dollar gate money they had to spend it on buying their bus tickets maybe back to southern california or even further up north but i was the lucky one my wife was waiting there with her camera i could see her she was snapping pictures of me like a paparazzi i walk briskly towards her gave her a quick kiss whispered in her ear let's get out of here before they say we made a mistake we got in the car drove away i saw a seven eleven i was like hey babe pull over lemme i wanna go in and get something so i went in and i grabbed a pack of big red gum i hadn't had chewing gum in twenty six years big red was my favorite we got back in the car drove away we were on the road for about thirty to forty five minutes and i s i spotted a target i said hey babe that's target i saw that on the uh tv pull over lemme i wanna go in there so we did the first thing that caught my eye was how big the shopping basket was it was bigger than the space that i had to store my personal property while in prison i grabbed the basket and went down the aisle grabbing various things such as underwear socks t-shirt toothbrush toothpaste you name it i grabbed it well there goes that two hundred dollar gate money so back in the car my wife says so what do you want for dinner whoa she's stumped me with that one because for twenty six years no one had ever asked me what do i want for dinner my dinner came through a thirteen by thirteen hole in the wall you stick your hand in there and pull out a tray and what's ever on there that's what you eat so she says i know what to fix so she drove we made it to the grocery store went into the grocery store this gigantic store berkeley bowl so i made it to the produce section i'm stuck there are so many oranges to choose from and the reason and i'm stuck just looking at the oranges is because for the past ten years in prison they had taken oranges away from us because they were used to make wine so there's like a bumpy orange a smooth orange a navel orange i even met my first blood orange and at the same time this wave hit me of alone and feeling like i don't know a nervous feeling hit me like i'm the only person in this store who's paroled from a prison today after twenty six years i'm a little stuck a little so i'm looking around and i spot this ink work it's not the typical ink work that i see out here now like with colors no i know this ink work this is prison ink he has a prison guard tower on him a meltic clock with time i know that work i've seen that many times so i walk over to him and i whisper so what yard did you parole from he said oh me i got i paroled from pelican bay like four months ago i'm like and they know you got out of prison they know you on parole aw yeah they not tripping here this is berkeley man nah nobody's tripping well i walked away from him with the understanding that if he can get a job so can i so i met my wife at the checkout once again there's another stunned moment for me there are twelve checkout lines and there's somebody on the other end bagging the groceries in prison there was one window maybe thirteen by thirteen again and there was like three hundred guys waiting to get into this one window with their lists i didn't have to worry about an alarm going off or anything no getting down we're gonna get our groceries and leave out of here that was my thought cool so we made it through the made it through the checkout went back to the car got in the car and we're on the road and we come to a stoplight and this homeless guy had a sign that says anything will help so my wife reaches into the cup holder and gets ready to hand him some change and all of a sudden he gets a phone call and he tells my wife wait i gotta take this call and my thoughts was like ih if he got a cellphone i gotta get one so we drive away and my wife uh she just drives real fast right and we make it to the neighborhood just as fast as we got to the store and she pulls into the neighborhood and she points out the various neighbors' house um this is where fred and mike live the brewers live here and i'm like okay and we get to our house and she said this is us and we live at the edge of the forest i'm like cool cool and so we went inside and she gives me the grand tour and so she says well i'm gonna prepare this dinner i said cool so she made steak and lobster with small potatoes nothing out of a can folks nothing out of a packet either she made this meal we sat down we ate and i had my first glass of wine with my meal not them i'm not saying i've never had wine before i've never had wine with a meal this is some grown folks' shit i thought right so after the meal was finished we're cleaning up washing dishes my wife says you wanna get further acclimated i'm like yeah she said take out the garbage no problem i reach down tie that garbage bag up throw it over my shoulder and out to the front door i go when i open up the door no more than eight feet away from me was a ten point buck just standing there looking at me look at it standing staring at me now had we been on a prison yard me and this buck woulda had issues now i speak a lot of different gangster languages i'm fluent in crip i understand blood i even speak a little sh olo vato loco but i don't speak deer so i shut the door i call out to my wife i said hey babe there's somebody here to see you she came to the door opened it and saw there was the buck she grabbed the trashbag and walked right past it i said damn she speaks deer she came back and we both look out the door together at this buck who's still standing there just looking just majestic as could be and my wife says you don't need to trip him he's just one neighbor coming to welcome you to the neighborhood cool i thought like well the fellas aren't gonna believe this shit when i tell them this i met my first deer i met my first blood orange i had my first glass of wine with my meal wow this is my first day of my new life what's tomorrow gonna bring me thank you
so i get a phone call from my mom and she tells me that my father is about to get on an emergency life flight from our home in montana to go to denver to get an emergency liver transplant my mom is kinda perennially optimistic and she's telling me don't worry it's gonna be ok we're gonna pull through this it's gonna be alright but i know something is is really wrong so i get the next flight i can to go from where i'm living here in new york hoping that i get there before my father dies and i'm really glad i i got that flight as fast as i did because i was able to spend a couple hours with my father before he passed away and before i know it i'm at this side of his hospital bed with my mom and we're sobbing because he's passed um my dad was a he was a strong silent type he was um he was a grew up on a farm and he was the town one of one of two town eye doctors so he could fix anything you know he could fix tractors or eyes he could you know no matter what and he was always doing it like behind the scenes you know he never wanted to take credit for it um it was apparent that my mom and i and um my two brothers were gonna have to be fixing things ourself this time around and the first thing my mom did was was to call my two brothers one's a year older one is a year younger and it was gonna be really comforting to see my younger brother we were really close um it was gonna he was really gonna support me um it was gonna be much more complicated seeing my older brother um we'd always had a a really complicated relationship and there was something really big about me that he did not know and that's that the last time he saw me um years and years before i was male he was not aware that i had transitioned from being male to being female and you know i always wanted to to tell him i was trying to find the right time the right place trying to you know get up the nerve um i was worried about his reaction maybe that you know he was a bit conservative he had a temper i didn't know how it's gonna happen and i just kept s putting it off and um never found the right time and here we are at the time where i have to deal with all this stuff uh marc wasn't the only one who didn't know my story my whole hometown didn't know about me either and you know i was trying to find a way to tell marc i just kind of figured with my hometown i just i just would never go back there again so my mom uh calls my brother and in one phone call tells him that he lost his father and that he now has a sister um and i have to say i mean marc was he was really great um he he got off the plane we met him at the airport he gave me a hug um but it was awkward as you can imagine and you know i think we did what a lot of families do at times like that you just kind of fall back on tradish tradition and we um wanted to uh do something that my mom and dad had always done every year um because you see it was my father's birthday he had passed away twenty minutes before um before his his sixty fifth birthday so we all went to applebee's and we got a slice of sizzling apple pie and put a candle in it and my brother marc who really worshipped my father got the honor of of blowing out the candle and when he was blowing out the candle i re i still remember the expression on his face he was you know trying to process my father's passing he was figuring out why it had been so long that the two of us hadn't talked something that really frustrated him and um it was just all kind of coming together i i took a business card out of my purse uh it was for this job that marc didn't even know i had it had my new name on it and i wrote my cell phone number on it and i gave it to marc i said look you know we haven't talked for so long but here any time any place no barriers call me any t we're you know we can talk anytime you want and my mom started crying because her you know her her children were reuniting and also because sh you know for years she had been running interference between the two of us and using every excuse in the book to explain why i wasn't getting back to him or why you know packages to me were being returned because they had the wrong name on them and it you know her job running interference was over so marc was in shock um we were all in shock i was i was in shock because i was thinking about the fact that you know nobody in my hometown knew and i'm wondering if i can go back for the for um the funeral if i if i should go back if my mom and and my brothers really want me to really deep down um and i'm thinking that you know i never even thought that i was gonna go back to my hometown and now i'm being i'm being pulled back right into it as contradictory as it may seem as soon as there was a reason to go back i had this really deep strong yearning to go back i mean i i had gone to school in new york and san francisco and travelled all over the world and this place that i thought of as home uh that i think i really repressed knowing that i couldn't go back there right i don't i don't need to go back there but as soon as there was a reason for me to go back there very strong reason i really really wanted to go i wanted to see the house the only house i had ever known growing up i wanted to go back to my hometown and these people that you know comprise this community that i thought of as home right and my mom um reassured me that she she wanted me to be there that she in fact needed me there for support my brothers too and my mom had a plan to get us there you know our our family had been separated for a long time so she had the idea for all of us to rent a car and drive the twenty hours from denver back to montana so before you know it there we are in the car you know my has brother hasn't seen me for years especially not as female and here were are and we we we had so much to do we were plan we were planning his servi my my father's funeral service we were writing his obituary my mom wanted to figure out and i did too wanted to figure out how we could introduce the information about me while still keeping the focus on my father so she had me driving out in the you know cross wyoming seventy miles an hour she had me take dictation of of her friends and she wanted to invite them over for tea so she had this really strategic list it's like you invite judy and she's gonna tell all the people in the arts community that my mom was involved in and you're gonna tell june and june is gonna tell all the people at dad's office and we'll find somebody else in the she's gonna tell everybody uh at the church and the next night there they were eighteen of my mom's best friends uh and the minister from the church where the service was was gonna be performed they're drinking tea my mom says you all know very well by now that i've lost my husband and i know a lot of you have wondered what happened to my middle son who seemed to disappear and um she said i want you to know tonight that i i have a daughter and her name is kim and this is my child and i love my child and i hope you do too and we can focus on this tonight we can talk about this tonight um you all are my ambassadors if someone has questions at the funeral and i'm caught up in things i want i'm going to point them to you and let you tell this story because you can talk about it in a sensitive way and she um you know took a couple a couple questions from the people there and the whole tea party ended slightly different than the tea party we hear about in the news uh the whole thing ended with everybody raising their teacups and saying hip hip hurray for kim hip hip hurray for kim there were a couple amens and some applause and and then everybody went home and i swear there was a brownout from all the simultaneous phone calls that were being made dispensing the information right so then the next night there was a viewing f of of my father's body at the at the funeral home and i had elected not to go because you know i didn't want the focus to be on me i was gonna keep it on everybody keep it on my father um but my best friend tim from high school was at the viewing and he calls me up um he had only known the new me for a couple days i hadn't even told him uh but he knew me really well and he knew i was chickening out and he called me from the the the funeral parlor and he said hey gotta lot of people here that really want to see you um i should probably tell you that the people he's talking about are the football team um cause i used to be on the football team and so applause for that eh um and so tim says where are you i gotta lot of people who want to see you i'm like yeah i don't want to go and you know i want to keep the focus on my dad i don't want to be the and he's like yeah yeah whatever either you come down here or we're gonna come up there what's it gonna be i said i've i sh i come up here i guess so before i know it the football team is at my front door and couple of em have cases of beer under their arm one case gets tossed in the snow bank to keep it cold it's just like high school and all of a sudden they're in my living room and it's this wake instantly and a show of support for me and for the memory of my father right and they're in my living room this living room i never even thought i would see again and people were either laughing or crying mostly laughing um and i remember looking around the room and there there's there's kevin he was one of the co captains of the football team with me and i look over there and there's my brothers marc and todd and they were you know we were all very close in age so we sh had friends in common and they're telling stories about my dad and there's um i look ah um i look over on the couch and there's frank ah sh probably should have ald you a also told you that um not only was i on the football team but i was the quarterback um and so i look over on the couch and there's frank he's an offensive lineman it's the job of an offensive lineman to protect the quarterback and frank is protecting me once again twenty years later under very different circumstances and he's got his arm around my girlfriend they're laughing and knocking back cans of cheap beer and that was the moment that i knew things were gonna be ok somehow and there was one more person there that night and that was my mom and she told me something that we ended up repeating quite a bit that weekend uh through the services um she came up and she said you know dad was always fixing things and it looks like he fixed this too she said you know even though your father has died you've been reborn thank you very much
tom waits loved the novel jt leroy had written called sarah he wanted to do an interview with jt leroy for vanity fair magazine and he wanted jt's input on who would photograph the spread cause jt leroy was notoriously shy one of the reasons why jt was so shy was cause jt didn't have a body jt was an avatar so let me take you back some years i was sixteen seventeen years old and i was a ward of the state in a group home in new york city eight girls one bathroom and the girls had all had stories being some had been raped stabbed by a parent sold into slavery everyone had secrets at night time we would tell our secrets and you couldn't tell and i was the one they would come to and would tell their stories and if you asked me why i was there i don't know all the intakes dysfunctional family i dropped out of school i don't know {cg} {cg} so i was always interested in how do you tell and there was this movie street wise it was a documentary by mary ellen mark about homeless kids in seattle and i gathered up some of my friends my best friend lauren from the group home we had been institutionalized together prior to the group home and we went and saw this movie and we saw ourselves on the screen now the street can seduce you and these kids were getting swallowed and we knew we were just one step removed and when we left the movie i saw how people looked at us right before they were kind of scared of us and i got off on that you know cause we had street all over us but after the movie they looked at us with this kind of curious compassion and suddenly i didn't want to be the victim in the movie i was interested in how do you make that bridge so people suddenly care and you're curious enough to maybe care how do you do that and in the group home everyone's telling their stories and i don't even know how to tell mine i don't even have the tools to tell mine and i would go to buy a little relief to a street corner there was a phone booth right on the corner and i would remove it from me i'd be a boy and i'd call hotlines and i'd tell them all the stories my stories my pain everyone's stories the house parent who survived the biafran wars and would say to me laura your job is to tell our stories cause in the group home my job was i was the translator so some girls having some problems with the house parent they'd come to me and i would translate between what each other was saying again if you asked me i don't know all i knew is if you heard what my story was my deepest belief was that you would say well you deserve it wheh stih you're disgusting you're horrible my deepest hope was that you wouldn't but i never ever gave you the chance but i wanted to learn the tools to tell cause that's the bridge and i won a scholarship to the new school for social research and they let me in without the sats i said i can't take the sats my last grade of completion is sixth and they let me in with a with an essay and i'm taking every writing class i can get my hands on and i wrote this piece in this class about you can tell a kid that's not gonna survive long on the street because the scars run this way and the kids are there wrap enwrapped you know and and and everyone's looking to see whose exterior matches the story and everyone's looking at this one cool guy he's all raggedy and i'm in the group home and i'm just looking i'm looking at him too and i wanted to be him cause he matches the voice and i don't want them to know it's me cause it's going to ruin it i wanted to be him and then when they leave cause they don't know it was anonymous reading the story and then and then when we leave i hear people talking about wow i never thought of it that way i didn't know that about this scene and that and i'm like that's what i want how do you get people to see what they never what they never saw before they they never knew before i keep writing but never as myself the writing gives me a little more relief i start writing under the name jeremy which becomes jt {cg}  for me i buy myself another day everytime i can find a way to tell but as long as it's not coming from me never as a woman so when i got asked by tom waits when he asked jt leroy who he wants to photograph mary ellen mark my sister in law came over one day and she just shaved her head and i'm looking at her and she looks like the blonde hair blue eyed little boys that i would see in the after school specials when they were just starting to talk about abuse sexual abuse always a blonde hair blue eyed cute little boy that you would forgive and love no matter what they did no matter how transgressive and bad they were you just loved them i i never saw myself represented in any of that so she looked {cg} she was jt and she agreed to be my avatar now mary ellen mark said that the person she was photographing did not feel like somebody who had suffered liked someone it felt like someone who maybe came from privilege but she said the books needed to be in the world that the books showed a world she had never seen that she wanted the books to be out there and she photographed the avatar {cg} i continued to publish under the name jt leroy i wrote the book sarah which was received with great acclaim i published it as fiction all my work as fiction came to pass that this book that explored the wilds of west virginia a state i had never been in in this kind of magic i played with gender and identity and it's the spirit everything that i had experienced all the pain all the suffering the joy the hope the holding on to finding that a possibility of being saved no matter what the spirit the humor it was all in there turned upside down in this book sarah came to pass that i am revealed as jt leroy the articulation in the new york times is hoax perpetrator culprit the jig is up come clean liar fake fiction writer no new york times fake fiction writer oscar wilde said give a man a mask and he'll tell you the truth i received death threats hate mail was black listed sued in federal f ing court people didn't understand why i wouldn't apologize she won't apologize i wouldn't how could you apologize for what kept it kept me alive i couldn't do it another way i knew no other way slowly the fan mail came back i would get letters where people would talk about what the work meant to it how it transformed them how it saved their lives how it allowed them to see a world that they had never seen before i got invited to speak welcome back into the community of artists to speak all over the world in spring i did a sold out reading at foyles in london and i'm signing books as me and these collectors are there and you know i'm i'm signing books where editions in languages that i didn't even know existed and uh uh uh this sign this sign this sign this and i'm leaving my body and all of a sudden the crowds kind of part and this girl comes walking towards me she's big and she's got cuts all over her arms she's carrying a bag and i know what's coming it's what i've been preparing for my whole life she reaches in her bag and i know she's gonna stab me and she takes out a book and she tells me that she came to my work after the reveal she ah asks me to sign her diary i realize that everything that had happened up to that moment had prepared me for this and i got up and i held her thank you
so about a month into my daughter's kindergarten career beginning of her being in school i was informed by her mother that her teacher was concerned about uh how she was doing and a month into kindergarten you would think that there's not a whole lot that you need to know ha how to do but apparently  my daughter was was giving her teacher cause for concern and so at at the earliest opportunity which was the parental uh observation day around halloween i went in to observe the class and uh it was all very familiar and i it was clear to me what her teacher meant even though it had been delivered to me in a really ambiguous and and hard to understand way i i watched my daughter just be herself uh in this classroom kind of blissfully unaware of of what was expected of her um it seems all very innocent kindergarten and everything but that's where they start training you how to be a part of society which if you're into that kind of thing that's awesome um but you don't have much much choice though in this world but so i'm watching her and watching her like do her thing and watching her teacher get frustrated with her to the point of like near anger just because she's not jumping to the next uh thing that's being assigned to her because they have like little sections in the day or in the afternoon for they have to work on and uh it was very familiar uh a nice thing that can happen with having children is that you can see yourself and you can be reminded of of of the progression of your own life through viewing them and i was i was brought back to my experience beginning kindergarten and i i can see myself very clearly and my daughter we share a lot of (br} similarities and i remember being handed like rudimentary mathematics that you're supposed to start in kindergarten and not being interested at all so not even bothering uh it was it wasn't clear to me that you were that wa it was like required uh it was clear to me that she was kind of in the same place and uh her teacher besides rubbing me the wrong way you know in a in a lot of ways clearly didn't understand my daughter i didn't want my daughter to stay in that school i wanted her out um and that could be just it it's hard to say when you're dealing with your children because you know everyone thinks that their children are god's gift to the planet you know or sane people do sane people do um so i i wanted her out i didn't think it was g it was a good place for her but i i didn't think anything was wrong with her but of course i didn't because i'm her father and uh it's very difficult to see your children clearly because i i would i would like to say because of the uh incredible amount of love that you have for them but that's not totally honest because there's something besides the love there's ego involved because there's such reflection of you you want them to do good you want them to be smart you want them to be beautiful because you i mean you're smart and you're beautiful and you do good you know or that's how you wanna perceive yourself in this world and you want your children your offspring to t to to have that that's maybe a little ugly but it's true and i think it's true for most parents um so i do love my daughter a great deal and i love myself and i wanted wanted her outta that school and uh her mother a very fine woman um brilliant a and beautiful we're partnered in raising her we're not partnered romantically didn't wanna uh hear me that that maybe that the teacher had the problem because she was beginning a career as a teacher and she always heard parents talk about how how it was the teacher's problem and that they wouldn't be able to actually see their children and i had no idea how hard it was to be a teacher with all these kids and blah blah blah not blah blah blah i'm sure she had points but we really we're very very good at disagreeing we can disagree very strongly but i can see myself in my kid and i i can see myself sitting at the kindergarten desk that she was sitting at i can see the similarities and a lot of the similarities come down to an attribute that is slowness like it real slowness that uh we share that has been like uh frustrating to teachers and parents and friends and lovers and roommates and any number of people um for instance like it it it really can and often does take me an hour to put on my shoes and i i can't tell you where the time goes it's not like i got distracted and started playing records or something like i can sit in the same place putting on my socks and shoes for an hour so can my daughter we can lose weekends just sitting on the toilet and uh if this apartment where where i spent time with my daughter there's only one toilet so that i'm sta that's easy for me to see the similarities you know um uh thinking about how we see our children and how we see ourselves and our children and how we want to see ourselves in a in a positive light we don't want something to be wrong with our children um it makes me think about a moment in time when i was seventeen years old and i was watching television with my father uh episode of nova uh it's like a science program that was on i think it was on pbs i don't know if it still exists um this one was on neuroscience and neuro neuroscience technology and uh they're had a guy getting prepared for a cat scan and being receiving a cat scan and it filled me with this crazy wave of uh of like deja vu but not just regular deja vu like deja vu mixed with dread and like sickness to my stomach and i it was overwhelming and i couldn't stop thinking about it and wondering if like did i have a cat scan so i turned to my father and asked him if i had a cat scan he said no and fell back asleep and then uh i couldn't get out of my head and i started remembering more and more this experience of being a little kid and getting a cat scan and uh um i finally went to my mother asked her and she didn't wanna talk about it and i persisted and she uh she admitted that i had had a cat scan when i was six years old something like that and i asked her why i'd had a cat scan and she didn't wanna talk about it but she started laughing a little bit and uh which is weird from where i was standing you know kind of filled with dread and having like this like repressed memory come up uh and uh finally she admitted i had had a cat scan and she told me why she said that i was um so slow that they thought that i was retarded and i had been given a battery of tests to test my cognitive ability and the tests were inconclusive and they couldn't figure out the jury's still out trust me um but uh the tests were inconclusive so they thought that maybe i just had a brain tumor and uh so they were gon they that's why i got the cat scan i don't know if you're ever had one but uh i don't even like giving blood for a for a blood test i don't i this is actually thinking about it right now probably exactly why i hate western medicine entirely and will do anything to stay away from a doctor um well a cat scan they have to like take your clothes off if and uh if you're little and you don't wanna take your clothes off in a room full of strangers and then they this my memory is so i don't know i guess they inject something into your ankle like an iodine solution and then you they lay you on a table and you get slid into a tube that sends whatever rays through your body to look into your brain to see what's going on um totally fucking terrifying like uh i remembered trying to escape i remembered screaming until i was hoarse i remembered uh my father coming into the room and talking me down i remember having my clothes put back on and taken to the gift shop and my father bought me a book of animal limericks and and rhymes and photographs of the animals all these animals from north america black hard covered book i remembered that book and i had it through childhood but i didn't remember anything about the cat scan after i left the hospital cause that it sucked that bad um my parents loved love love me love their children uh and uh that couldn't have been anything but painful and frightening for my father too you know the whole situation um and i i so i'm just thinking about what motivated them to go to that extreme to see what was wrong with me okay so it turns out that no brain tumor as a child just slow i'm just slow i have figured out ways to live my life that it doesn't really matter as far as survival is concerned and actually i've been able to thrive you know by degrees and and uh i i had to think about that so tempted to sing so tempted to push it so past the time that she starts playing and i have to improvise a song on top of it to finish the story i won't do that um just thinking about um not doing that to my child you know having the f the having the good fortune to have a child that's so much like me that i can take my experiences and and help her at least in this moment i don't know what the future holds and i don't know who she's going to become you know but uh i can use my experience in a way to to lessen her her potential problems in this world which is what you ultimately ultimately ultimately wish for as a parent um her mother went to talk to the teacher a couple weeks later and came back horrified and wanted to but she's not a violent person but she she wanted she wanted our daughter out too so we took our daughter out of that school she's now at a steiner school which really suits her much better and uh we're both slow
in all honesty i'm gonna start out by admitting i sometimes lie occasionally i'll include a lie in the story i'm telling if i think it'll make the story better i don't do it to protect the innocent because i don't know any stories where the people in them are innocent and i don't do it to be shocking either though i admit to to once telling a story where i exaggerated the length of my penis in my own defense i exaggerated down and not up and i did it for the laughs you the story i'm telling you tonight does not have a lie in it or many laughs for that matter when i'm done telling you this story you may think it's nothing but a lie but i'd ask you to trust me on this at the age of nineteen i fell prey to a powerful and deeply corrupting influence it dogged me for six years costing me many a friend and in process bringing my family to ruin it crippled me to such an extent that i have spent the intervening fifteen years recovering from it the influence i speak of is hope now you should know at the get go there's nothing in my childhood to suggest i might find myself on such a wayward path as that my parents loved me terribly they taught me right from wrong they taught me to be courageous in the face of bullies they taught me patience and forgiveness they taught me that love would see you through any misfortune my trouble began on independence day not the independence day but my independence day my independence day occurred on memorial day nineteen eighty two that was the day i told my family i was gay the act itself mom dad i'm gay was relatively unexceptional in fact it should have been more exceptional and i've always sort of wished that it had been however subsequent events overshadowed it and it pales by comparison the subsequent events occurred in my absence after the fact as i was in my car driving back to college to take my final freshman exams i remember being on the highway and thinking how you know i kind of expected my parents to freak out a little and you know to my surprise they had not freaked out they'd been calm and cool and collected oddly calm cool and collected but still i was really happy as i drove back to school meanwhile subsequent events were busy unfolding back home my mother was going through the house where i grew up and was gathering together things i'd made for her um a jewelry box when i was in four h and a painting when i was sixteen um a box of letters con or a box containing the letters that i'd written them from school which i used to do every week she was removing photographs from the walls and placing them in little piles around the house and she was directing my father who never dared not follow her direction to take the bed and the desk and the chair and the lamp and the smith corona my smith corona even and to put them all in the front yard next to the rock garden not too close to the maple tree my clothes my books my bookcases my report cards my farah fawcett posters my shoes three years worth of interview magazines the good ones with the andy warhol covers everything then with my brother and my sister and my grandparents watching my mother removed a cigarette from this tiny crocheted case she always kept them in and she lit the cigarette and then she took the match and put it to the pile of things there in the front yard that contained the soul and complete record of my existence in my family it burned for seven and a half hours thanks in part to the addition of some lighter fluid to help get the larger pieces of furniture going all of it all that was me prior to that memorable memorial day up in flames according to my sister who years later recounted these details to me it was a mighty impressive blaze {cg} in their eagerness to feed it and due to an unexpected wind off the fields around the house the sugar maple that was older than my great grandfather caught a spark in its branches and was sacrificed they cut off all communication with me they emptied and closed our joint bank account there goes college they barred the door they stopped talking stopped answering my letters stopped taking my calls they stopped anything with me they just stopped i was completely disbelieving i mean this didn't make any sense uh all of my friends had you know stories about telling their families they were gay and they all ended the same way sooner or later everything worked out fine so i even had a friend named neil whose parents had done the same thing you know at first they just stopped talking to him but one year later they were inviting his new boyfriend to come home with him for the holidays everyone counseled me to have a little patience and have a little hope and this is how it starts slowly just a little hope just enough to get you through but hope is cumulative a little bit here and a little bit there it builds up in the system until it becomes something toxic denial i mean their reaction had been yes extreme but not the worst that could happen the thing to do was to be a good son to make them proud to earn back their love so i got a job and then another and then a third three shifts three restaurants six days a week that would show them but they weren't watching i wrote them letters lots of letters about nothing you know it's uh tuesday and it's hot or my new roommate is named kathy or my friends took me out for my birthday yesterday they didn't write back living for me sort of came to a halt um despite the fact that my life just went on and on i didn't think about my future i didn't think about my needs i didn't think about my sadness i didn't think about any of it i didn't have to because i had hope everyday whispering in my ear don't give up don't walk away you're almost there don't stop don't grow don't develop don't don't worry just don't make any sudden movements or you'll blow it {sl} uh so six years went on like this without a word from them so finally hurt and confused beyond my ability to hold it in and frankly finding it really difficult to maintain the illusion that this was temporary i decided to kind of make one more attempt to force the issue so i i flew home and showed up unannounced at my mother's office it was an amazing visit excuse me {sl} i asked the receptionist to to page my mother and tell her she had a surprise visitor and i stood there in the lobby {cg} and i remember seeing my mother come down this long hallway toward me and she was walking and then she sort of looked up and she saw me and then she recognized who it was and she turned and walked away again it was a really amazing ninety second visit two and a half weeks later a black funeral wreath was delivered to me at my office with a note that said in memory of our son clearly it was time to give up hope and take up therapy so i uh i talked to a counselor who asked me why i had invited this turmoil into my life i uh i talked to a minister who suggested a christian youth camp i i talked to a lesbian who offered to slash my mother's tires if i'd pay for her flight there i signed up for scream therapy where i beat pillows with tennis rackets and screamed obscenities and you know pulled a muscle in my shoulder mostly i talked to friends and mostly the pain persisted the sheer weight of it nearly crushed me or at least that's how it felt at the time since it was my constant companion i spent most of my time turning it over in my mind fingering it like some sort of psychological worry stone over the years it's been eroded by so much handling all that remains now is a small hard nearly weightless pebble really worn away is most of the anger and much of the hurt but one question remains how was it possible that they taught me love and loyalty in excess of that which they themselves possessed i have come to believe that it's not possible to understand what they did not possible for me anyway to understand it would seem to indicate that there was some justification for it and i know for certain that there is not still there's no escaping my parents this um this thing they did this extreme and unfathomable and many layered thing they did tore a hole in the middle of my life i have spent years and a lot of money darning that hole while trying to keep the rest of my world from unraveling and yet their influence on me is enduring my parents loved me terribly i have been courageous in the face of bullies there is such a thing as too much patience but no such thing as too much forgiveness and love has seen me through every misfortune thank you
