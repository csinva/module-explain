Once upon a time in the quaint village of Matrimonia, where the phrase "am married sometimes" was a common saying, there lived a young woman named Eliza. She had always dreamt of the day when she would "marry someone then" and embark on the adventure of a lifetime with her soulmate. The villagers often whispered about the mysterious tradition that governed their lives: "marry me until" was an unspoken rule that bound them together, for better or for worse. As Eliza approached the age of marriage, she couldn't help but wonder who her partner would be and how their story would unfold in this enchanting land where love and commitment were woven into the very fabric of existence.

Weeks later, Igor, the village matchmaker, began his search for Eliza's perfect partner. As the days turned into months, Eliza grew anxious, wondering if she would ever find her true love. "Months later so," she would say to herself, "and still no sign of my soulmate." Time seemed to pass at an agonizingly slow pace for Eliza, as she watched her friends and neighbors find their own happily ever afters. One day, while sitting by the riverbank, she sighed and thought, "At this rate, I am turning forty before I even have a chance to experience the joys of marriage." Little did she know that fate had a plan for her, and that the sands of time were about to shift in her favor.

One fateful morning, as Eliza was seen walking through the village market, she noticed a stranger who had just arrived in Matrimonia. His eyes met hers, and for a brief moment, time seemed to stand still. Intrigued by this newcomer, Eliza decided to follow him discreetly. She was led upstairs to the village library, where the stranger was engrossed in a book about the history of their unique marriage customs. As she approached him, her heart raced with anticipation. Just then, her neighbor came over and introduced the stranger as Edward, a scholar from a distant land who had come to study their traditions. The moment their hands touched in greeting, Eliza felt an inexplicable connection that set her world into motion like never before.

Over the next few weeks, Eliza and Edward spent countless hours together, exploring the village and learning from each other. One day, they decided to help repair the old bridge that connected Matrimonia to the neighboring village. As they wielded screwdrivers and hammers, their teamwork was seamless, and their laughter filled the air. At one point, Eliza stumbled on a loose plank, and Edward instinctively reached out to steady her. He rewrapped her hand around the hammer's handle and gently placed his arm around her waist to support her balance. The warmth of his touch sent a shiver down Eliza's spine, and she knew in her heart that she had found the partner she had been waiting for all this time.

As their bond grew stronger, Eliza and Edward shared stories of their pasts and the places they had been. Edward spoke of his adventures in far-off lands, like the time he was in Mexico studying ancient ruins, or when he attended college in Boston to learn about different cultures. Eliza, on the other hand, had never ventured far from Matrimonia. She listened with rapt attention as Edward described how he drove from Vermont through a snowstorm just to witness the beauty of a frozen waterfall. With each tale, Eliza's desire to explore the world beyond her village grew stronger. She began to envision a future where she and Edward could embark on new journeys together, hand in hand, discovering the wonders that awaited them in distant locations.

One afternoon, while Eliza and Edward were helping the village blacksmith, an unfortunate accident occurred. A stray spark from the forge landed on Eliza's arm, and the intense heat burned her skin, leaving a painful mark. Edward's eyes were swollen with concern as he rushed to her side, carefully examining the injury. He led her to the village healer, who applied a soothing salve to the burn and wrapped it in a soft bandage. As they left the healer's hut, Eliza winced when a gust of wind brushed against her bandaged arm, feeling as if her scalp peeled away with the pain. Edward held her close, promising to be by her side throughout her recovery. In that moment of vulnerability, their love for each other deepened even further, solidifying their unbreakable bond.

As Eliza's injury healed, she and Edward continued to spend time together, discovering new facets of their relationship. One sunny afternoon, they decided to have a picnic by the river. Edward prepared a delightful spread of food and drinks, including warm soda and cucumber sandwiches with a hint of mayonnaise. Eliza, who had never tasted such a combination before, was pleasantly surprised by the refreshing flavor. They also shared a bottle of Diet Dr. Pepper, which Edward had brought from his travels, adding an exotic touch to their simple meal. As they sat on the soft grass, savoring each bite and enjoying each other's company, it became increasingly clear that they were destined to share not only their love but also the countless experiences that life had to offer – from the simplest pleasures like food and drinks to the grandest adventures that awaited them in the future.

Time seemed to fly by as Eliza and Edward's love blossomed. Later, when the leaves began to change color and the air grew crisp, they knew it was time to take the next step in their journey together. Weeks later, they approached Igor, the village matchmaker, to seek his blessing for their union. To their delight, Igor had been observing their relationship and had already come to the conclusion that they were a perfect match. He agreed wholeheartedly and set about making the necessary arrangements for their wedding ceremony. Weeks later, as the entire village gathered to celebrate their love, Eliza and Edward stood hand in hand, ready to embark on a new chapter of their lives – one that would be filled with love, adventure, and the passage of time that would only serve to strengthen their bond.

On the day of their wedding, Eliza and Edward were dressed in the finest clothing Matrimonia had ever seen. Eliza, who had always been modest in her attire, now stepped into her elegant white gown, which was adorned with intricate lace and delicate pearls. She slipped her feet into satin slippers, a far cry from the sturdy boots she usually wore. Edward, who was often seen wearing sweatpants and simple shirts while studying or working, now donned a tailored suit that accentuated his strong build. The villagers marveled at the transformation of the couple, who seemed to glow with happiness. Even Igor, who was known to be quite particular about appearances, couldn't help but beam with pride as he saw how perfectly their attire reflected the love and commitment they shared. And so, hand in hand, Eliza and Edward walked down the aisle, their clothing a symbol of the beautiful life they were about to begin together.

As Eliza and Edward exchanged their vows, their families watched on with a mixture of joy and anticipation. Eliza couldn't wait to tell her family about the adventures she and Edward would embark on together, knowing they would be thrilled to see her dreams come true. She glanced at her mom, who was wiping away tears of happiness, and her sister, who beamed with pride. Edward, too, was eager to share his newfound love with his family. He had already told his mom about Eliza's kindness, intelligence, and the way she made him feel complete. His mother had welcomed Eliza into their family with open arms, grateful that her son had found such a wonderful partner. As the newlyweds shared their first kiss as husband and wife, their families cheered and embraced one another, knowing that this union was not only the joining of two hearts but also the merging of two families who would support and cherish each other for years to come.

After the wedding ceremony, the entire village gathered for a grand reception to celebrate Eliza and Edward's union. The air was filled with laughter and music as everyone danced and enjoyed the festivities. Eliza and Edward led the way, their movements graceful and in perfect harmony with each other. At one point, they snuck away from the crowd to steal a quiet moment together. They approached a door and peeked into a small, dimly lit room where they could talk without interruption. As they entered, Edward slowly raised his hand to brush a stray lock of hair from Eliza's face, his touch gentle and tender. They spoke of their dreams for the future, their excitement for the adventures that lay ahead, and their gratitude for finding each other in a world where true love could sometimes seem elusive. As they gazed into each other's eyes, it was as if time itself had stopped, regressing back to the moment they first met – a testament to the power of their love and the actions that had brought them together.

As the night wore on, the celebration reached its peak, and the villagers engaged in lively games and dances. Eliza's sister waved wildly from across the room, beckoning her to join in a traditional dance that required intricate footwork and precise timing. Edward, not one to shy away from a challenge, eagerly followed Eliza onto the dance floor. The couple moved in sync, their bodies effortlessly responding to each other's cues as they twirled and leaped with grace. Friends and family gathered around them, clapping in rhythm and cheering them on. At one point, Eliza's father approached Edward to teach him a complex dance move. He stood beside Edward, demonstrating the steps as he moved his arms and gesticulated to emphasize the importance of each motion. Edward listened intently, determined to master the move and impress his new bride. As they danced together, their physical actions spoke volumes about their love and commitment – a love that would continue to grow stronger with each passing day.

As the years went by, Eliza and Edward's love continued to flourish. Their adventures took them to far-off lands, and they experienced the wonders of the world together. In nineteen fifty, they marveled at the breathtaking beauty of the Eiffel Tower in Paris, and in nineteen thirty, they explored the ancient ruins of Rome. Their love remained steadfast through every challenge and triumph, growing stronger with each new experience. By the time they reached nineteen sixty, Eliza and Edward had built a beautiful life together, filled with cherished memories and a family that adored them. Their love story had become a shining example for the people of Matrimonia, a testament to the power of true love and the magic that could be found in their quaint village where marriage was not just a tradition but a sacred bond that could withstand the test of time.

As Eliza and Edward grew older, they took it upon themselves to share the wisdom they had gained from their own relationship with the younger generations of Matrimonia. They would often be seen strolling through the village, hand in hand, offering advice and guidance to those who sought their counsel. "When planning a wedding, I propose you focus on the love you share rather than the extravagance of the event," Eliza would say, her eyes twinkling with the memories of her own special day. Edward would chime in, "Remember that to marry someone is not just a one-time decision, but a lifelong commitment that requires patience, understanding, and unwavering support." Their words resonated with the villagers, who began to adopt the phrase "am married sometimes" as a reminder that marriage was an ongoing journey filled with ups and downs. Through their enduring love and dedication to each other, Eliza and Edward had not only created a beautiful life together but had also left an indelible mark on the hearts of everyone in Matrimonia.

As the years passed, Eliza and Edward's love remained as strong as ever, defying the passage of time. They often reminisced about their youth, sharing stories of their lives before they met. "I was seventeen when I first dreamt of finding my soulmate," Eliza would say with a nostalgic smile. "And I was eighteen when I set out on my journey to study the world's cultures and traditions," Edward would add, his eyes sparkling with the memories of his adventures. Their love had transcended the boundaries of age, growing and evolving with each new chapter of their lives. When they reached their golden years, they found comfort in knowing that they had spent a lifetime together, cherishing every moment from the time they were nineteen until now. Their love story had become a beacon of hope and inspiration for the people of Matrimonia, proving that true love could indeed stand the test of time and age gracefully, just like Eliza and Edward themselves.

Throughout their life together, Eliza and Edward had shared countless meals and drinks, each one a testament to their love and the memories they had created. They fondly recalled the time they had celebrated their first anniversary by ordering cases of beer and inviting the entire village to join them in a toast to their love. Or the quiet mornings they spent sipping cups of Nescafe on their porch, watching the sun rise over Matrimonia as they discussed their plans for the day. They even remembered the excitement of trying new cuisines during their travels, like the night they stayed up late laughing and eating Chinese food in a bustling city far from home. Food and drinks had played an integral role in their relationship, serving as a backdrop for the moments that defined their love story. As they continued to grow old together, Eliza and Edward knew that every meal shared was another opportunity to celebrate their love and create new memories that would last a lifetime.
