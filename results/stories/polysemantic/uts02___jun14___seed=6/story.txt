Once upon a moment in time, nestled within the rhythmic ticking of a grandfather clock, a peculiar event unfolded. It all began when young Thomas, a curious boy with an insatiable appetite for adventure, discovered an ancient pocket watch in his grandmother's attic.

A minute later, as Thomas examined the intricate engravings on the watch's surface, he felt a sudden surge of energy coursing through his veins. An hour later, he found himself standing in front of a mysterious door that had appeared out of nowhere in his room. As he hesitated to turn the knob, the doorbell rang, heralding the arrival of an unexpected visitor who would change the course of his life forever.

As Thomas opened the door, he was greeted by a tall, enigmatic figure clad in a tailored suit. The stranger introduced himself as Mr. Tempus, a timekeeper tasked with maintaining the delicate balance of time. He explained that the pocket watch Thomas had found was no ordinary timepiece; it was a powerful artifact capable of manipulating time itself. Mr. Tempus had been searching for an apprentice to assist him in his duties, and he believed Thomas was the perfect candidate. To prove his worth, Thomas would have to complete three trials that tested his ability to navigate the treacherous waters of time. The first trial required him to clean an office that had been ravaged by the sands of time, restoring it to its former glory. The second trial involved shopping the registries of history, collecting crucial moments that shaped the world as we know it today. And finally, for the third trial, Thomas would have to face his own mortality by writing his obituary, acknowledging the fleeting nature of life and the importance of making every moment count. With a determined glint in his eye, Thomas accepted Mr. Tempus's challenge and embarked on an action-packed journey through time, eager to prove himself worthy of becoming a guardian of this precious

In his quest to clean the office, he stumbled upon a bustling marketplace in ancient Rome, where he sampled some sliced cucumber and lemon slices, marveling at the simplicity and freshness of the flavors.

He learned that Mr. Tempus had already called ahead to other guardians of time, ensuring that they were aware of Thomas's arrival and prepared to offer assistance if needed.
